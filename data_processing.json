        "abstract": "This chapter emphasizes specific contributions, advantages, and weaknesses of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques various purposes: (1) knowledge-based reasoning that applies heuristic knowledge to make policy search more robust, or to satisfy trading principles in a competitive economy, (2) machine learning to learn the behavior of economic agents, (3) decision rationalization in decision support systems, and case-based reasoning, and (4) integration of databases and knowledge bases via suitable knowledge representations. In the real world of economic analysis, AI approaches must be scalable and tunable to changing characteristics without having to change the underlying techniques or algorithms. In economic applications, better explanation-based interfaces are necessary between the user and the system. From the perspective of business, almost no AI research addresses economic competition theories, either with reference to game theory, or to disequilibrium theories. The strongest potential of some AI techniques lies in their data/information fusion capability, which is little explored. This holds especially for neural networks, case-based reasoning, and knowledge representation standards.",

        "abstract": "Volatility has been one of the most active and successful areas of research in time series econometrics and economic forecasting in recent decades. This chapter provides a selective survey of the most important theoretical developments and empirical insights to emerge from this burgeoning literature, with a distinct focus on forecasting applications. Volatility is inherently latent, and Section 1 begins with a brief intuitive account of various key volatility concepts. Section 2 then discusses a series of different economic situations in which volatility plays a crucial role, ranging from the use of volatility forecasts in portfolio allocation to density forecasting in risk management. Sections 3–5 present a variety of alternative procedures for univariate volatility modeling and forecasting based on the GARCH, stochastic volatility and realized volatility paradigms, respectively. Section 6 extends the discussion to the multivariate problem of forecasting conditional covariances and correlations, and Section 7 discusses volatility forecast evaluation methods in both univariate and multivariate cases. Section 8 concludes briefly.",

        "abstract": "We review key aspects of forecasting using nonlinear models. Because economic models are typically misspecified, the resulting forecasts provide only an approximation to the best possible forecast. Although it is in principle possible to obtain superior approximations to the optimal forecast using nonlinear methods, there are some potentially serious practical challenges. Primary among these are computational difficulties, the dangers of overfit, and potential difficulties of interpretation. In this chapter we discuss these issues in detail. Then we propose and illustrate the use of a new family of methods (QuickNet) that achieves the benefits of using a forecasting model that is nonlinear in the predictors while avoiding or mitigating the other challenges to the use of nonlinear forecasting methods.",

        "abstract": "We analyze in this chapter decision-making when costs and benefits of an action are uncertain, that is, when future preferences are uncertain. We begin, in Section 2, with the classical analysis by Krutilla et al. (1972) of whether the expected consumer's surplus is a correct measure of the net benefits from the action. It turns out that for one individual, the correct measure is the expected consumer's surplus corrected with one term representing the covariance between the state-contingent consumer's surplus and the state-contingent marginal utility of wealth and a second term representing risk aversion. This corrected measure is what Krutilla et al. (1972) called the option value. Thus the difference between option value and expected consumer's surplus is determined by the covariance between preferences and consumer's surplus and risk aversion. The sign of this difference will therefore depend on these factors. We apply this result to a number of cases in order to derive additional useful results. First we look at the aggregate (over a set of individuals) option value and establish a general result. We then apply this result to the allocation of risk in the context of both public and private goods. In Section 3, we introduce relevant dynamic elements to the general problem of decisions under uncertainty. We analyze actions that may have irreversible effects, but where the decision-maker can improve her information about the true future preferences. This problem was first studied by Arrow and Fisher (1974) and Henry (1974), who showed (as we do in Section 3.2) that when the decision-maker has to choose between two actions, of which one is irreversible, and future benefits are uncertain in the first time period, maximizing expected value will result in a biased result: the irreversible action will be chosen too often. However, this result is based on assumptions of linearity. In order to study the problem without this restriction, we rely on Epstein's (1980) framework, which we present in some detail. The result is that convexity (concavity) assumptions are essential to establish the direction of the bias. We also use Epstein's framework to look at issues such as uncertainty about cost of restoration and uncertainty about irreversibility. All of the results to this point are for models with just two time periods. In Section 4, we analyze the many-period case, adopting a somewhat different analytical framework: stochastic dynamic programming, as presented in Dixit and Pindyck (1994). Additional results in continuous time are developed, drawing on the theory of stochastic processes. We look in particular at the optimal stopping problem, a useful and important special case, and present an empirical application due to Conrad (1997): when, if ever, to cut an old-growth forest that also yields benefits in its natural state.",

        "abstract": "The topic of this chapter is forecasting with nonlinear models. First, a number of well-known nonlinear models are introduced and their properties discussed. These include the smooth transition regression model, the switching regression model whose univariate counterpart is called threshold autoregressive model, the Markov-switching or hidden Markov regression model, the artificial neural network model, and a couple of other models. Many of these nonlinear models nest a linear model. For this reason, it is advisable to test linearity before estimating the nonlinear model one thinks will fit the data. A number of linearity tests are discussed. These form a part of model specification: the remaining steps of nonlinear model building are parameter estimation and evaluation that are also briefly considered. There are two possibilities of generating forecasts from nonlinear models. Sometimes it is possible to use analytical formulas as in linear models. In many other cases, however, forecasts more than one periods ahead have to be generated numerically. Methods for doing that are presented and compared. The accuracy of point forecasts can be compared using various criteria and statistical tests. Some of these tests have the property that they are not applicable when one of the two models under comparison nests the other one. Tests that have been developed in order to work in this situation are described. The chapter also contains a simulation study showing how, in some situations, forecasts from a correctly specified nonlinear model may be inferior to ones from a certain linear model. There exist relatively large studies in which the forecasting performance of nonlinear models is compared with that of linear models using actual macroeconomic series. Main features of some such studies are briefly presented and lessons from them described. In general, no dominant nonlinear (or linear) model has emerged.",

        "abstract": "One of the only places where environmental quality is traded on explicit markets is real estate. There are several techniques that can be used to study the effects of environmental quality on property values and infer willingness to pay for improvements. The most commonly used method is the hedonic model. In environmental economics the hedonic model has mainly been applied to the prices of real property and to wages. It assumes that there is a schedule of prices for the differentiated product (i.e., houses) that can be estimated. An alternative set of models postulates that consumers' choices are discrete between houses rather than continuous in characteristics as in the hedonic model. Discrete choice models are applied to estimate consumer preferences. Recently a model has been developed that mixes discrete and continuous decisions and emphasizes the locational equilibrium. This chapter reviews these techniques, with an emphasis on methodological issues and recent developments. Section 2 describes the theoretical models that underlie these techniques. The theoretical hedonic model is developed first, and then the theoretical modifications that are necessary for the discrete choice models are described. The main models are developed for residential properties, but differentiated factors of production are discussed briefly. Section 3 is devoted to the empirical issues involved in estimating a hedonic price schedule. This is the most common type of estimation in property value models. Section 4 discusses the empirical application of the second stage of the hedonic model, the estimation of the underlying preferences. Section 5 covers the two types of discrete choice models that are used in environmental economics, random utility models and random bidding models. Section 6 briefly discusses the new locational equilibrium models, and the final section is devoted to conclusions and directions for further research.",

        "abstract": "This chapter is concerned with laboratory tests of job search models. Formal models of job search specify certain common elements, i.e., the length of the search horizon, the searcher's discounting rate of interest, the net costs (subsidies) to search in each period of the search horizon, and the searcher's knowledge about the wage offer distribution he or she faces. Because these factors are difficult, if not impossible, to observe in the naturally-occurring economy, controlled laboratory tests of the search model offer the only practical means for formally testing search models. A basic job search model of interest to economists specifies a finite search horizon. Searchers know the (discrete) wage offer distribution and must accept or decline an offer when it is received. The search model has sharp predictions for a utility maximizing, risk neutral agent. In this case the agent seeks to maximize the expected present value of the income from search. This can be accomplished by choosing an appropriate (minimally acceptable) reservation wage each period.",

As part of a structural analysis, typical influencing factors and parameters defining the driver take-over task are discussed. According to literature, existing studies examining the driver take-over task make use of various test environments. However, the comparability of their results is not given without a detailed understanding of these. Hence, based on established literature, a technologically independent framework has been developed which can be used to describe the distinct test environments. It turned out, that the referenced models had to be partially restructured in order to be suitable for the description of such test environments. The focus of the present paper lies on their technical implementation characterized by stimulus materials, which have been holistically examined for the driver take-over task. Since stimulus materials provide the foundation of a specification of test environments, this work presents an initial step towards a test specification aiming on making results obtained from examinations of the driver take-over task comparable.",

The question becomes whether or not the principles of Nash equilibrium can be viewed in the behavior as modification of the attitudes or whether the attitudes themselves induce fundamentally different principles of behavior that can replace the strategic behavior of game theory. The substance of the papers is that strategic behavior is a deep and reliable property of human behavior in conﬂict environments. A sophisticated experienced weighted learning model is compared to reinforcement learning and weighted fictitious play across a variety of games. The structure of these models is discussed together with interpretations of the measured parameters and areas of potential improvement.",

In these settings the question is whether people overstate their true evaluations. They provide a comprehensive review of a wide range of experiments allowing the existence of hypothetical bias to be determined, concluding that the existence of such bias, while highly variable, is persistent and cannot be ignored in the use of CVM instruments.",

In particular, we provide a detailed review of the key empirical studies in the area of consumer demand for those foods which can be broadly considered as environmentally responsible products (ERPs). We give this definition because the choice of ERPs is a consequence of individual concerns towards environmental and health issues and consumers are directly and indirectly responsible for the environmental and health effects of their food consumption choices. The decision to purchase ERPs should reduce negative environmental effects from intensive agricultural practices, helping to preserve a public good like the environment. Consumption of ERPs should also curb health risks from chemicals for all the household members eating the food purchased in the shops. Therefore, the choice of ERPs reflects both “public” and “private” demands.",

        "abstract": "New restrictions on short-selling sovereign debt need to be supported by concrete evidence that links systematically unrestricted short-selling activities to fraud, abuse or market manipulation. OECD debt managers noted that there is plenty of empirical evidence on the benefits of short selling, including more liquidity, pricing efficiency and better allocated risk. However, solid evidence in the form of empirical data on market instability unambiguously caused by unrestricted short-selling activities (to be counted as ‘costs’) seems to be lacking. Debt managers also noted that the reporting requirements will be costly from a purely administrative point of view. A ban on uncovered short selling transactions of sovereign debt would make risk management more difficult and expensive, with detrimental effects on market efficiency, liquidity and funding costs for sovereigns. Moreover, it is unlikely that such bans would have a stabilising effect in government securities markets during a crisis. Rather than containing the crisis, a ban on short selling of government debt is likely to worsen the situation. The paper concludes that OECD debt managers have a range of tested tools at their disposal for dealing with temporary or chronic dysfunctional measures in sovereign debt markets, ranging from ‘quantity measures’, such as openings, to ‘pricing measures’ such as dynamic fails charges.

        "abstract": "Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models use modern macroeconomic theory to explain and predict comovements of aggregate time series over the business cycle and to perform policy analysis. We explain how to use DSGE models for all three purposes – forecasting, story-telling, and policy experiments – and review their forecasting record. We also provide our own real-time assessment of the forecasting performance of the Smets and Wouters (2007) model data up to 2011, compare it with Blue Chip and Greenbook forecasts, and show how it changes as we augment the standard set of observables with external information from surveys (nowcasts, interest rates, and long-run inflation and output growth expectations). We explore methods of generating forecasts in the presence of a zero-lower-bound constraint on nominal interest rates and conditional on counterfactual interest rate paths. Finally, we perform a post-mortem of DSGE model forecasts of the Great Recession, and show that forecasts from a version of the Smets–Wouters model augmented by financial frictions and with interest rate spreads as an observable compare well with Blue Chip forecasts.",

        "abstract": "Ageing will translate into long run trends in supply as well as demand of capital in the next decades. This paper provides some quantitative assessments of the effects on financial markets of ageing in four large OECD countries (United States, Japan, Germany, and France). Using a simplified general equilibrium model with overlapping generations, it suggests that ageing could bolster capital-labour ratios and lower interest rates in the future (by 25 bp to 100 bp in the long run, depending on the characteristics of pension systems reforms). In this context, the fear for a future “asset meltdown” due to ageing is probably overstated. The model also suggests that the individual accumulation of capital is likely to increase in the future and require structural changes in financial markets. Households will increasingly need to insure against the uncertainty related to future asset prices, rates of return on capital or individual longevity....",

        "abstract": "This article presents highlights from the forthcoming OECD cross-country study Public Debt Management and Bond Markets in Africa. Debt managers from an increasing number of emerging market jurisdictions face challenges similar to those of their counterparts from advanced markets due to competitive pressures from global finance and the related need to implement OECD leading practices in this policy area. The article shows that OECD standards in public debt management and related market operations are, therefore, of great importance for public debt management and bond market development in Africa. Several African debt managers have introduced the leading debt management practices of OECD countries, use them for designing new debt strategies (including for managing contingent liabilities), and have made impressive progress in developing their local government securities markets. Many countries in the region are taking advantage of debt reduction initiatives. Avoiding falling back into positions of unsustainable debt is identified as a key challenge for many African governments. OECD financial policy makers are increasingly interested in developments in emerging markets, including those on the African continent. Moreover, emerging markets (including the latest emerging market region, Africa) are an increasingly important asset class for investors from the OECD area. Thus, the policy conclusions and priorities identified here are of interest to not only African countries but also the OECD area and other emerging market countries. Local bond markets in several African countries have gained in strength in terms of liquidity and maturity structure, making them more attractive for important categories of OECD investors and less vulnerable to exchange rate shocks.",

We focus primarily on agent-based models developed by economists and political scientists. These models address collective action problems, questions related to institutional design and performance, issues in international relations, and electoral competition. In our view, complex systems and computational techniques will have a large and growing impact on research on politics in the near future. This optimism follows from the observation that the concepts used in computational methodology in general and agent-based models in particular resonate deeply within political science because of the domains of study in the discipline and because early findings from agent-based models align with widely known empirical regularities in the political world. In the process of making our arguments, we survey a portion of the growing literature within political science.",

This chapter investigates the use of economic forecasting in policy making by discussing practical examples, providing new empirical evidence and computing forecasts using different macroeconomic models. First, a theoretical framework is presented to differentiate the role of forecasts in simple feedback rules, optimal control policies, and forecast targeting. Then, we review institutional details of the forecasting process at fiscal authorities and central banks. We provide empirical evidence that central bank policy rate decisions in the United States and the Euro area are well described by interest rate rules responding to forecasts of inflation and economic activity rather than recent outcomes. Next, we provide a detailed exposition of methods for producing forecasts. We review forecasting models and provide practical applications. In particular, we illustrate how to use economic structure in interpreting forecasts and how to implement different conditioning assumptions regarding certain planned policy initiatives. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of central bank and expert forecasts and investigate the interaction between forecasting and policy making by evaluating the performance and robustness of forecast-based policy rules under model uncertainty.",

Examples include public good games, ultimatum games, Bertrand, Cournot, some auctions, asset markets, New-Keynesian, and general equilibrium models with sentiments/animal spirits. This becomes feasible by considering BC specifications with a best response or optimal action as a function of other players' aggregated actions. For characterizing an integrated account of heterogeneity in economics, as observed in BC experiments, we employ a non-equilibrium model, the so-called “level-k” model, based on one (or more) reference point(s) and (limited) iterated best responses. Level-k and related models thus bridge the gap between non-strategic (e.g. irrational, intuitive or random) behavior and equilibrium choices. We also give a brief overview of interactive decision-making within experimental economics, and discuss elicitation methods, cognitive and population measures, to better understand heterogeneity in human reasoning in general, and in economic experiments in particular.",

The appropriate method for computing Nash equilibria for a game depends on a number of factors.

The problem of finding one equilibrium is a well studied problem, and there exist number of different methods for numerically computing a sample equilibrium. The problem of finding all equilibria has been addressed recently. While, there exist methods for computation of all equilibria, they are computationally intensive. With current methods, they are only feasible on small problems. The chapter overviews methods for computing sample equilibria in normal form games, and discusses the computation of equilibria on extensive form games.",

These methods permit the consideration of accurate models and the inclusion in the analysis of the effects of uncertainty. The progress in sectoral modeling is based on the foundation of earlier work in activity analysis, linear programming, and the solution of models with economies of scale that permits the development and solution of realistic models with many commodities, processes, productive units, plants, and markets.",

        "abstract": "In this chapter I explain an innovative modeling approach that incorporates services, foreign direct investment (FDI) and endogenous productivity effects from services. I begin with a small stylized model to help understand the fundamental economics. The model shows that services liberalization yields welfare gains several multiples of the welfare gains obtained from a constant to returns to scale model. Further, the welfare gains are supported by the econometric estimates of the gains from trade or FDI liberalization. I then describe computable general equilibrium studies by my colleagues and I conducted for the Russian government on the potential effects of Russian accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). We find that the projected welfare gains generated from liberalization of barriers against foreign direct investment are about 5% of consumption, with the total benefits of all aspects of WTO accession being about 7% of consumption. We find that almost every household in Russia would be expected to gain from WTO accession. We show, however, that a model of Russian WTO accession that fails to incorporate FDI in services and endogenous productivity effects from additional services would yield an estimated gain of less than 1% of consumption with about 7% of the households losing. Reviews of the work have indicated that the work has had a significant influence on the public debate and helped the Russian government to steer public opinion in favor of WTO accession. In the process of doing this work, T. Rutherford and I developed a technique for incorporating tens of thousands of households as agents of the model. All of the major results in the chapter are shown to be robust under sensitivity analysis.",

Second, the conditions under which instability is observed are not captured by the cobweb model but such conditions are captured by models of the form developed by Marshall and Walras in which the market has perversely shaped curves, such as an upward-sloped demand or downward-sloped supply. Third, the appropriate model, Marshall or Walras, depends on properties of the underlying demand and supply. If the special shape is due to the existence of an externality such as a fad or a Marshallian external economy, then experiments have demonstrated that the Marshallian model is the appropriate model. If the special shape is due to income effects, then the appropriate model is the Walrasian model and not the Marshallian model. That is, if the special shape is due to income effects such as Giffen goods or a backward-bending supply of labor, then the Walrasian model reﬂects the appropriate principles. In summary, the mystery of the price discovery process is solved, in part, by classical models of adjustment.",

Consumption of an outdoor recreation site's services requires the user to incur the costs of a trip to that site. Travel costs serve as implicit prices. These costs reflect both people's distances from recreation sites visited and their specific opportunity costs of time. Today, economic analyses of recreation choices are among the most advanced examples of microeconometric modeling of consumer behavior in economics. The primary focus of this chapter is on the methods used to describe individuals' recreation choices. We are interested in the economic assumptions made in descriptions of behavior and measures of the economic value of amenities. Before developing this summary, in Section 2 we discuss how outdoor recreation fits within consumers' overall expenditures. Section 3 describes how we might ideally like to estimate consumers' preferences for recreation resources and the compromises implied by the models currently being used. Econometric details are deferred until Section 5, after a discussion of the features of recreation data in Section 4. In Section 6 we turn to conceptual issues in welfare measurement. We close in Section 7 with a discussion of a few research opportunities that seem especially important for the future.",

Four potentially significant social externalities associated with fertility behavior and use of the local natural-resource base are identified. Three are shown to be pronatalist in their effects, while the fourth is shown to be ambiguous, in that it can be either pro-or anti-natalist. It is shown that one of the externalities may even provide an invidious link between fertility decisions and the use of the local natural-resource base. The fourth type of externality is used to develop a theory of fertility transitions in the contemporary world. The theory views such transitions as disequilibrium phenomena.",

It aims to present current perspectives and review key issues in mathematics education.Knowledge is transmitted, explored and advanced via language face-to-face, in printed texts, and in other media. Children and their teachers write, read, talk and listen mathematics. Mathematics education begins and proceeds in language, it advances or stumbles because of language, and its outcomes are often assessed in language. \"Language and Mathematical Educuation\" presents current perspectives and reviews the key issues. It brings together in one volume work from researchers concerned with various aspects of language in mathematics education. Each contributor provides an account of their research and draws out the practical implications in terms which will inform and guide teachers. Following the introductory section there are sections exploring: language and early experiences of number; language and meanings in mathematics education; word problems; the uses of discussion; language, mathematics and disability; and cross-linguistic issues. This book examines how language plays significant and problematic roles in mathematics education, reveals some of the ambiguities and complexities in the way language is used in the mathematics curriculum; and will be a useful resource for all mathematics educators.",

However, lignin is widely recognized as waste byproduct of the cellulosic ethanol and pulp and paper industry. How to properly modify lignin and develop it into functional polymers is a huge challenge, but an attractive research topic in both industry and academia. This book brings together leading engineering approaches to address the challenges of lignin valorization. It presents the chemistry and properties of different types of lignin, and explores the cutting-edge approaches of lignin modifications. Unlike any existing texts, this book not only summarizes the traditional ways of using lignin, but also presents various potential applications of lignin materials together with advanced processing techniques. The basis of lignin (its chemistry, types and properties) is described, as are different approaches to modify it. The features of lignin and its copolymers are explored and aligned with their potential applications. In addition to the carbon materials from lignin, the advanced fabrication approaches to engineer lignin-based micro/nano-structural materials are summarized--",

            "\"This is the first single volume about the collapse theories of quantum mechanics, which is becoming a very active field of research in both physics and philosophy. In standard quantum mechanics, it is postulated that when the wave function of a quantum system is measured, it no longer follows the Schrödinger equation, but instantaneously and randomly collapses to one of the wave functions that correspond to definite measurement results. However, why and how a definite measurement result appears is unknown. A promising solution to this problem are collapse theories in which the collapse of the wave function is spontaneous and dynamical. Chapters written by distinguished physicists and philosophers of physics discuss the origin and implications of wave-function collapse, the controversies around collapse models and their ontologies, and new arguments for the reality of wave function collapse. This is an invaluable resource for students and researchers interested in the philosophy of physics and foundations of quantum mechanics. Shan Gao is Professor of Philosophy at the Research Center for Philosophy of Science and Technology at Shanxi University. He is the founder and managing editor of the International Journal of Quantum Foundations, and is the author of several books including the recent monograph The Meaning of the Wave Function: In Search of the Ontology of Quantum Mechanics (Cambridge University Press, 2017).

            "Materials have played a revolutionary role in the development of the modern technological age, and their various applications have made our lives increasingly comfortable here on our home, the beautiful blue planet Earth. With the application of heat, pyroelectric materials produce electric current, qualifying them for use in uncooled infrared detectors. Infrared detectors are encountered in a vast number of applications in both war and peace - many of their uses are routine to us in everyday life. With the advent of new technologies, thermal sensing and imaging have become useful diagnostic tools for medical, industrial, and military applications. In medicine, infrared thermal imaging is applied to detect vascular disorders and arthritic rheumatisms as well as to monitor muscular performances and make preclinical diagnoses of breast cancer. Recently, these materials have been used in nuclear particle generation, and their usefulness in energy harvesting is currently under exploration. This monograph contains comprehensive cutting-edge information on pyroelectric materials and their preparation, properties, and applications, such as uncooled wideband infrared detectors, particle generators, and ambient energy harvesters. The complete lifecycle of a pyroelectric material is presented here for readers - from the theory of operation, to structure, and processing and applications - providing a cohesive overview of all of the necessary concepts, including theoretical background and current developments in the field of pyroelectric devices. It describes the preparation, structure, properties and figures of merit for practical pyroelectric materials such as triglycine sulfate, lead zirconate titanate, lithium tantalate, lithium niobate, barium strontium titanate, lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate, polyvinylidene fluoride, zinc oxide, and others, including the merits and demerits of their use in devices",

Consequently, there is a growing need for individuals who are knowledgeable in the design, development, and production of such systems. This book provides an overview of the design of plastic optical systems and is structured along the lines of a typical development project. Following a brief background discussion, the advantages and disadvantages of plastic optics are considered. Next, the available materials and their properties are described, as well as the issues of material selection and specification. Various manufacturing methods are reviewed, followed by a chapter on design guidelines, leading into several design examples. Following the examples, the prototyping and testing of a design is covered. Finally, bringing the design to production is discussed. Several groups will benefit from the material presented, including optical engineers, technical managers, and engineers of other disciplines who need to design and develop plastic optical systems but lack the knowledge or training to do so. With the help of this book, readers should understand the benefits and limitations of plastic optical systems and be able to determine if this technology is appropriate for their applications. They will have the basic knowledge to undertake the design of these systems, should they choose to do so themselves, or they will be able to have the appropriate conversations with the individuals or companies they ask to perform the work",

Governments of origin and destination countries can indeed facilitate the involvement of diasporas, by supporting networks, by facilitating communication channels with the country of origin, by creating an enabling environment, or – more directly – by easing skill mobility and use. In this regard, the capacity to characterise the profile of diasporas is instrumental. This joint OECD/AFD publication includes 140 country notes summarising diaspora sizes, including the number of children of migrants born in the destination countries; the characteristics of emigrant populations (gender, age, education, labour market outcomes); the numbers and main destinations of international students; recent migrant flows to OECD countries; and information on the desire to emigrate of different population groups. The country note information is grouped into six regions: Asia and Oceania; Latin America and the Caribbean; OECD countries; Non-OECD Europe and Central Asia; Middle East and North Africa; and Sub-Saharan Africa. The situation in each region is introduced by a separate chapter, which looks at historical migration trends, the main characteristics of diasporas originating from the region, and likely future developments and challenges.",

        "abstract": "A potentially troubling aspect of modern vehicle design - some would argue - is a trend towards isolating the driver and reducing vehicle feedback, usually in the name of comfort and refinement but increasingly because of automation. There can be little doubt cars have become more civilised over the years yet, despite this, the consequences on driver behaviour remain to a large extent anecdotal. Readers of this book will have heard such anecdotes for themselves. They usually take the form of drivers of a certain age recalling their first cars from the 1970's or 80's, in which \"doing 70mph really felt like it\". The question is whether such anecdotes actually reflect a bigger, more significant issue that could be better understood? Related questions have been explored in other domains such as aviation, where the change to 'fly-by-wire', for example, did indeed bring about some occasionally serious performance issues which were not anticipated. Despite some clear parallels automotive systems have been left relatively unexamined.

            "\"Governing Compact Cities investigates how governments and other critical actors organise to enable compact urban growth, combining higher urban densities, mixed use and urban design quality with more walkable and public transport-oriented urban development. Philipp Rode draws on empirical evidence from London and Berlin to examine how urban policymakers, professionals and stakeholders have worked across disciplinary silos, geographic scales and different time horizons since the early 1990s. The key mechanisms for integrated urban governance which enable more compact growth are identified by focusing on the underlying institutional arrangements that have connected strategic urban planning, city design and transport policy in the two case study cities. These include a hybrid model of hierarchical and network governance, the effectiveness of continuous adjustment over disruptive, one-off 'integration fixes' and the prioritisation of certain links between sectoral policy and geographic scales over others. With an interdisciplinary approach connecting urban studies and planning with political science, public administration and organisational studies, this book will be of interest to academics and students in those disciplines, as well as urban practitioners and the applied/policy research community\"--Page 4 of cover"

            "Hungary and Poland have been heavily criticised for some time now because they pursue an ‘illiberal’ form of democracy and, in doing so, violate the principles at the heart of the EU. The combination of the right-wing populism prevalent in these countries and their tendency towards illiberal democracy conveys stark Euroscepticism. The author of this book has been working as a university lecturer of political economics in Hungary since 2012. This book collates a selection of essays and lectures in which he examines the significance of autonomous institutions for a free democracy, the EU’s problems with identification and legitimation, and Francis Fukuyama’s claim that history proves there is no better solution for society than to combine a constitutional democracy with a liberal economic system.The contributions collected in this book offer a nuanced perspective on the attitudes of central and southeast European countries, while also stressing the dangers that ‘illiberal’ democracies pose.",

Der Verfasser ist seit 2012 in Ungarn als Hochschullehrer für politische Ökonomie tätig und beschäftigt sich in seiner Sammlung von Aufsätzen und Vorträgen mit der Bedeutung autonomer Institutionen für eine freiheitliche Demokratie, mit den Identifikations- und Legitimationsproblemen der EU sowie mit der Behauptung von Francis Fukuyama, wonach die Geschichte belege, dass es keine bessere Lösung für die Gesellschaft gäbe als die Verknüpfung einer rechtsstaatlichen Demokratie mit einer liberalen Wirtschaftsordnung .Die im Buch zusammengefassten Beiträge bieten eine differenzierte Sicht zur Haltung mittel- und südosteuropäischer Länder, heben aber zugleich die Gefahr hervor, die von „einer Demokratie ohne Attribute“ ausgeht."

A series of short and nontechnical essays lays out the prospects of various experimental possibilities and their current status. Finding observational evidence for the quantization of space-time was long thought impossible. In the last decade however, new experimental design and technological advances have changed the research landscape and opened new perspectives on quantum gravity. Formerly dominated by purely theoretical constructions, quantum gravity now has a lively phenomenology to offer. From high precision measurements using macroscopic quantum oscillators to new analysis methods of the cosmic microwave background, no stone is being left unturned in the experimental search for quantum gravity. This book sheds new light on the connection of astroparticle physics with the quantum gravity problem. Gravitational waves and their detection are covered. It illustrates findings from the interconnection between general relativity, black holes and Planck stars. Finally, the return on investment in quantum-gravitation research is illuminated. The book is intended for graduate students and researchers entering the field."

        "abstract": "No area of law and policy is more central to our well-being than housing, yet research on the topic is too often produced in disciplinary or methodological silos that fail to connect to policy on the ground. This pathbreaking book, which features leading scholars from a range of academic fields, cuts across disciplines to forge new connections in the discourse. In accessible prose filled with cutting-edge ideas, these scholars address topics ranging from the recent financial crisis to discrimination and gentrification and show how housing law and policy impacts household wealth, financial markets, urban landscapes, and local communities. Together, they harness evidence and theory to capture the 'state of play' in housing, generating insights that will be relevant to academics and policymakers alike. This title is also available as Open Access.",

This book narrows down the scope of physical biology by focusing on the microbial cell; exploring the physical phenomena of noise, feedback, and variability that arise in the cellular information-processing circuits used by bacteria. It looks at the microbe from a physics perspective, asking how the cell optimizes its function to live within the constraints of physics. It introduces a physical and information-based (as opposed to microbiological) perspective on communication and signalling between microbes.",

J.G. Wissema explores this dramatic change, tracing the historic development of universities, and exploring the technology-based enterprises, technostarters and financiers for start-ups and young enterprises that are the main partners of these 3GUs. He goes on to illustrate that universities play a new role as incubators of new science or technology based commercial activities and take an active role in the exploitation of the knowledge they create. The book concludes with suggestions regarding the way in which changes in the university's mission should be reflected in subsequent organisational changes"

Such research is critically dependent upon good and reliable empirical data, and it is here that this Handbook contributes, providing a broad overview of up-to-date research methods and approaches. The chapters are written by distinguished researchers from a variety of scholarly traditions and with a background in different academic disciplines including economics, economic human and cultural geography, and economic history. Researchers and academics in economics and economic geography will find this a fundamental reference point and will benefit from the comprehensive assessment of research methods and approaches in the field.

The authors show that in the US, trends are highlighted in terms of wealth holdings, among the low-income population, along with changes in wealth polarization, racial differences in wealth holdings, and the dynamics of portfolio choices. The consensus between the authors is that wealth inequality has generally risen among these OECD countries since the early 1980s, although Germany stands out as an exception. In the case of the US, it is also noted that wealth holdings have generally failed to improve among low-income families and that the racial wealth gap widened during the late 1980s"

It critically examines the tension between top-down policies implemented by strong states to boost urban culture, which are typically focused on the hardware of iconic venues, museums, and opera houses mostly designed by famous western architects, and the need for freedom to enable more organic cultural initiatives rooted in local practices.' (Robert C. Kloosterman, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands). -- 'This book not only establishes the importance of cultural projects in crafting Asia's new global cities, it offers the first systematic comparison of both governmental plans and artists' actions in major urban sites from Beijing to Singapore. Whether art is viewed as an economic engine or a creative act, the authors show that it is a highly visible part of Asian societies that no one can ignore.' (Sharon Zukin, author of Naked City: The Death and Life of Authentic Urban Places). -- 'This volume makes two very significant contributions to the literature on Asian cities: it shifts the focus away from manufacturing and real estate as drivers of growth to the role of creativity in fostering the development of global cities; and it chronicles how arts and culture are changing the physical character of the cities studied. It is a highly welcome addition to our understanding of the dynamics of urban Asia and its increasing importance in generating global culture.' (Susan Fainstein, Harvard Graduate School of Design, US and author of The Just City). -- While global cities have mostly been characterized as sites of intensive and extensive economic activity, the quest for global city status also increasingly rests on the creative production and consumption of culture and the arts. Arts, Culture and the Making of Global Cities examines such ambitions and projects undertaken in five major cities in Asia: Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei and Singapore. Providing a thorough comparison of their urban imaging strategies and attempts to harness arts and culture, as well as more organically evolved arts activities and spaces, this book analyses the relative successes and failures of these cities. Offering rich ethnographic detail drawn from extensive fieldwork, the authors challenge city strategies and existing urban theories about cultural and creative clusters and reveal the many complexities in the art of city-making.",

In response, governments in Asia and the broader international community announced large aid programs.

This book discusses the lessons of the aid effort for disaster protection policy in developing countries. -- How effective was the aid? What lessons can be learnt about how to respond when disasters strike in poor countries? This insightful book addresses these questions drawing on three themes of current development policy: international aid policy; human security and the poor; and approaches to disaster risk reduction. The most important lesson is the need to ‘go local’ in building up resilience at the grassroots level in poor countries in Asia. Other lessons include the need for better cooperation between the international community and local and national organizations as well as the need to ensure that adequate funding is provided to support disaster protection and post-disaster recovery programs while taking into account cost inflation associated with large-scale reconstruction efforts.",

            "Pollution, alternative fuels, congestion, intelligent transportation systems, and the shift from construction to maintenance all call for a reconsideration of the existing highway revenue mechanisms, especially the gas tax. David Levinson explores the fundamental theoretical basis of highway finance, in particular the use of tolls, and supports that theory with empirical evidence. The author examines highway finance from the perspective of individual jurisdictions and travellers, and considers their interactions rather than specifying a single optimal solution. Congestion pricing has long been a goal of transportation economists, who believe it will result in a more efficient use of resources. Levinson argues that if the governance were to become more decentralized, and collection costs continue to drop, tolls could return to prominence as the preferred means of financing roads for both local and intercity travel. An approach that creates the local winners necessary to implement road pricing is required before it can be expected to become widespread"

            "This book seeks to gain a better understanding of the paradoxical relationship between the alleged need of European labour markets to become more flexible and the way in which national policies pursue this aim without jeopardising existing high standards of income and employment security. Special interest is devoted to the way in which countries opt for different policy routes to cope with the aim of balancing flexibility and security goals in their respective labour market and social protection policies. The contributions in this book all try to unveil the particular changes or transitions occurring in the various labour markets, to learn about their medium and longer term effects and the role of institutions and policies to cushion the adverse consequences of these changes. By studying some \"best practices\" in Denmark, Canada and Australia they also draw some important lessons about the reasons why national policies might either fail or better cope with the challenges Europe face today",

        "abstract": "\"For biblical authors and readers, law and restoration are central concepts in the Bible, but they were not always so. To trace out the formation of those biblical concepts as elements in defensive strategies, Cataldo uses as conversational starting points theories from Zizek, Foucault and Deleuze, all of whom emphasize relation and difference. This work argues that the more modern assumption that biblical authors wrote their texts presupposing a central importance for those concepts is backwards. On the contrary, law and restoration were made central only through and after the writing of the biblical text in particular, those that were concerned with protecting the community from threats to its identity as the \"remnant\". Modern Bible readers, Cataldo argues, must renegotiate how they understand law and restoration and come to terms with them as concepts that emerged out of more selfish concerns of a community on the margins of imperial political power.\"--Bloomsbury Publishing",

            "This book undertakes a detailed construction of Dynamic Markov Bridges using a combination of theory and real-world applications to drive home important concepts and methodologies. In Part I, theory is developed using tools from stochastic filtering, partial differential equations, Markov processes, and their interplay. Part II is devoted to the applications of the theory developed in Part I to asymmetric information models among financial agents, which include a strategic risk-neutral insider who possesses a private signal concerning the future value of the traded asset, non-strategic noise traders, and competitive risk-neutral market makers. A thorough analysis of optimality conditions for risk-neutral insiders is provided and the implications on equilibrium of non-Gaussian extensions are discussed. A Markov bridge, first considered by Paul Lévy in the context of Brownian motion, is a mathematical system that undergoes changes in value from one state to another when the initial and final states are fixed. Markov bridges have many applications as stochastic models of real-world processes, especially within the areas of Economics and Finance. The construction of a Dynamic Markov Bridge, a useful extension of Markov bridge theory, addresses several important questions concerning how financial markets function, among them: how the presence of an insider trader impacts market efficiency; how insider trading on financial markets can be detected; how information assimilates in market prices; and the optimal pricing policy of a particular market maker. Principles in this book will appeal to probabilists, statisticians, economists, researchers, and graduate students interested in Markov bridges and market microstructure theory"

After the crisis, the public sectors in the UK and Spain were subject to pronounced austerity measures, which had a massive impact on earnings and employment conditions as well as on the recognition and the rights of employees and trade unions. The crisis impacted differently on Sweden and Germany, however. Employment conditions had already deteriorated in Germany before the crisis, and since then earnings have been increasing. Despite all the procedural differences, the retrenchment of public services and the weakening of labour rights reveal themselves to be constant political projects.This study was conducted by an international and interdisciplinary team of sociologists, political scientists and historians at the Research Institute for Work, Technology and Culture (F.A.T.K.).",

            "This book covers mathematical foundations and methods for the computerized analysis of shapes, providing the requisite background in geometry and functional analysis and introducing various algorithms and approaches to shape modeling, with a special focus on the interesting connections between shapes and their transformations by diffeomorphisms. A direct application is to computational anatomy, for which techniques such as large‒deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping and metamorphosis, among others, are presented. The appendices detail a series of classical topics (Hilbert spaces, differential equations, Riemannian manifolds, optimal control). The intended audience is applied mathematicians and mathematically inclined engineers interested in the topic of shape analysis and its possible applications in computer vision or medical imaging. The first part can be used for an advanced undergraduate course on differential geometry with a focus on applications while the later chapters are suitable for a graduate course on shape analysis through the action of diffeomorphisms. Several significant additions appear in the 2nd edition, most notably a new chapter on shape datasets, and a discussion of optimal control theory in an infinite-dimensional framework, which is then used to enrich the presentation of diffeomorphic matching",

This concept was later introduced into optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, metamaterials, electric circuits, acoustics, mechanical systems and many other fields, where a judicious balancing of gain and loss constitutes a PT-symmetric system. Even though these systems are dissipative, they exhibit many signature properties of conservative systems, which make them mathematically and physically intriguing. Important PT-symmetry applications have also emerged. This book describes the latest advances of PT symmetry in a wide range of physical areas, with contributions from the leading experts.

            "This book discusses group theory investigations of zincblende and wurtzite semiconductors under symmetry-breaking conditions. The text presents the group theory elements required to develop a multitude of symmetry-breaking problems, giving scientists a fast track to bypass the need for recalculating electronic states. The text is not only a valuable resource for speeding up calculations but also illustrates the construction of effective Hamiltonians for a chosen set of electronic states in crystalline semiconductors. Since Hamiltonians have to be invariant under the transformations of the point group, the crystal symmetry determines the multiplet structure of these states in the presence of spin-orbit, crystal-field, or exchange interactions. Symmetry-breaking leads to additional coupling of the states, resulting in shifts and/or splittings of the multiplets. Such interactions may be intrinsic, as in the case of the quasi-particle dispersion, or extrinsic, induced by magnetic, electric, or strain fields. Using a power expansion of the perturbations these interaction terms can be determined in their parameterized form in a unique way. The hierarchic structure of this invariant development allows to estimate the importance of particular symmetry-breaking effects in the Hamiltonian. A number of selected experimental curves are included to illustrate the symmetry-based discussions, which are especially important in optical spectroscopy. This text is written for graduate students and researchers who want to understand and simulate experimental findings reflecting the fine structure of electronic or excitonic states in crystalline semiconductors",

            "Climate change is one of the most salient challenges expressed in the seventeen interconnected UN Sustainable Development Goals. A greater impetus has emerged in recent years for larger corporations to assume a pivotal role in framing the issues of climate change-focused policy, ensuring environmental sustainability across the value chain and in leading by example with best implementation practices. This collection of leading-edge research addresses the fast-evolving role of multinational enterprises as agents of change in standard development and as diffusers of innovation in solving sustainability problems. CSR and Climate Change Implications for Multinational Enterprises presents a unique lens to address generic issues and how they manifest and find resolution in various industry sectors, from the perspective of different disciplines ranging from logistics to finance to ethics. Contributors from the United States, Europe and emerging economies offer contrasting views on how corporate social governance best addresses the sustainability implications of climate change, seeking innovative ways to incorporate environmental stewardship in policy design and operational firm-level concerns. This is a critical resource for both researchers and practitioners, as well as policy makers who focus on sustainability in the corporate contexts. It serves as a fresh reference for graduate level students and academics concerned with global corporate governance in the evolving context of multinationality"

This data taking was very successful, with the first direct detection of a binary black hole merger (GW170814) using the full network of three interferometers, and the first detection and localization of a binary neutron star merger (GW170817). The second generation of gravitational wave detector, Advanced Virgo, is capable of detecting differential displacements of the order of 10-21m. This means that it is highly sensitive to any disturbance, including the seismic movement of the Earth. For this reason an active control is necessary to keep the detector in place with sufficient accuracy"

Beyond this partial understanding, the author suggests that rather than being merely utopian, the Megastructure of Metabolism represents a uniquely amalgam genre: the myth camouflaged as utopia. Although its Megastructure seemingly describes a desirable future condition as utopia does, it also comprises certain cultural images rooted in the collective (un)conscious of Japanese people, in accordance with the general interpretation of myth. The primary narrative of the book thus follows the gradual unfolding of the myth-like characteristics of its Megastructure. Myth is dealt here as an interdisciplinary subject in line with contemporary myth theories. After expounding the mechanism underlying the growing demand for a new myth in architecture (the origin of the myth), Part I discovers the formal characteristics of the Megastructure of Metabolism to give a hint of the real intention behind it. Based on this, Part II is a reexamination of their design methods, which aims to clarify the function of the myth and to suggest the meaning behind it. Finally, Part III deals with the subject matter of the myth by disclosing the meaning unfolding in the story, and suggests a new reading of Metabolism's urban theory: as an attempt to reconsider the traditional Japanese space concept",

            "Learn the new Document Store feature of MySQL 8 and build applications around a mix of the best features from SQL and NoSQL database paradigms. Don’t allow yourself to be forced into one paradigm or the other, but combine both approaches by using the Document Store. MySQL 8 was designed from the beginning to bridge the gap between NoSQL and SQL. Oracle recognizes that many solutions need the capabilities of both. More specifically, developers need to store objects as loose collections of schema-less documents, but those same developers also need the ability to run structured queries on their data. With MySQL 8, you can do both!   Introducing the MySQL 8 Document Store presents new tools and features that make creating a hybrid database solution far easier than ever before. This book covers the vitally important MySQL Document Store, the new X Protocol for developing applications, and a new client shell called the MySQL Shell. Also covered are supporting technologies and concepts such as JSON, schema-less documents, and more. The book gives insight into how features work and how to apply them to get the most out of your MySQL experience. The book covers topics such as: The headline feature in MySQL 8 MySQL's answer to NoSQL New APIs and client protocols What You'll Learn: Create NoSQL-style applications by using the Document Store Mix the NoSQL and SQL approaches by using each to its best advantage in a hybrid solution Work with the new X Protocol for application connectivity in MySQL 8 Master the new X Developer Application Programming Interfaces Combine SQL and JSON in the same database and application Migrate existing applications to MySQL Document Store",

These 294 letters cover multiple subjects, ranging from pure mathematics to magneto-optics and wave mechanics. They reveal much about their author, including Lorentz's surprisingly active involvement in experimental matters in the first decades of his career. Letters are also devoted to general relativity, Lorentz's 1908 lecture on radiation theory, and his receipt of the Nobel Prize along with Zeeman in 1902. The letters are presented in their original language; Dutch originals are accompanied by English translations. A concise biography of Lorentz is also included",

        "abstract": "“Hans Vollaard leads the debate about contemporary developments in Europe as the process of integration appears headed in reverse. His book is an essential reference point both for those who want to know what happened to existing theories and for those who are seeking to understand how popular dissatisfaction with the European project is likely to have an impact.” -Professor Erik Jones, Johns Hopkins University, USA “This is a brave pioneering effort to make sense of the current European predicament. Curiously, we have numerous theories of European integration and virtually none regarding the opposite process. Hans Vollaard’s book helps us to map and explain European disintegration from diverse theoretical angles. Students and practitioners of the EU should pay attention to his arguments.” -Professor Jan Zielonka, University of Oxford, UK This book accounts for whether and how the path of the European Union (EU) has developed towards potential disintegration. These questions have become particularly relevant since the outbreak of the debt crises in the Eurozone and the Brexit referendum. The author critically subverts theories of European integration and analyses the rise and fall of federations, empires and states in a comparative perspective. The most promising theory presented here indicates that Brexit is not likely to be followed by other member states leaving the EU. Nevertheless, the EU has been undermined from within as it cannot adequately address Eurosceptic dissatisfaction from both the left and right. This book is an essential read for everyone interested in the EU and its future",

This method allows the complete theory to be constructed starting from a small number of assumptions, and is the most natural approach in modern theoretical physics. The book begins by reviewing Newtonian mechanics and Newtonian gravity with the Lagrangian formalism and the principle of least action, and then moves to special and general relativity. Most calculations are presented step by step, as is done on the board in class. The book covers recent advances in gravitational wave astronomy and provides a general overview of current lines of research in gravity. It also includes numerous examples and problems in each chapter",

There has long been a lively debate surrounding this question, going back to David Hume and Immanuel Kant. This book is a new attempt to test its veracity. The existing literature tends to assume that the beneficial effects of inter state competition have been confined to European history. By contrast, China, India and the Islamic Middle East are regarded as inherently imperial and overcentralised. However, these civilisations have not always been unified politically. In their history, there have been long spells of decentralised rule or inter state competition. The same is true for Japan. If the Hume-Kant hypothesis is correct, it should also apply to those periods. This volume analyses the qualitative and quantitative evidence"

        "abstract": "\"Preface Methods of Statistical Model Estimation has been written to develop a particular pragmatic viewpoint of statistical modelling. Our goal has been to try to demonstrate the unity that underpins statistical parameter estimation for a wide range of models. We have sought to represent the techniques and tenets of statistical modelling using executable computer code. Our choice does not preclude the use of explanatory text, equations, or occasional pseudo-code. However, we have written computer code that is motivated by pedagogic considerations first and foremost. An example is in the development of a single function to compute deviance residuals in Chapter 4. We defer the details to Section 4.7, but mention here that deviance residuals are an important model diagnostic tool for GLMs. Each distribution in the exponential family has its own deviance residual, defined by the likelihood. Many statistical books will present tables of equations for computing each of these residuals. Rather than develop a unique function for each distribution, we prefer to present a single function that calls the likelihood appropriately itself. This single function replaces five or six, and in so doing, demonstrates the unity that underpins GLM. Of course, the code is less efficient and less stable than a direct representation of the equations would be, but our goal is clarity rather than speed or stability. This book also provides guidelines to enable statisticians and researchers from across disciplines to more easily program their own statistical models using R. R, more than any other statistical application, is driven by the contributions of researchers who have developed scripts, functions, and complete packages for the use of others in the general research community\"--",

        "abstract": "Biofuels will play a key role in the 21st century as the world faces two critical problems; volatile fuel prices and global climatic changes. Both of these are linked to the overdependence on the fossil fuels: petroleum, natural gas, and coal. Transportation is almost totally dependent on petroleum based fuels such as gasoline, diesel fuel, liquefied petroleum gas, and on natural gas. Despite a significant amount of research into biofuels, the field has not been able to replace fossil fuels. Recent advances will change this scenario. Extracting fuel from biomass has been very expensive (both monetarily and in land usage), time consuming, unusable byproducts, etc. Technology to obtain liquid fuel from non-fossil sources must be improved to be faster, more efficient and more cost-effective. This book will cover the current technology used for a variety of plant types and explore shortcomings with each.--",

It synthesizes fundamental ideas of the past 20+ years of research, carefully balancing theory and application. The book isolates and methodically develops key ideas by working through illustrative examples that are subsequently synthesized into general principles. Many of the seminal examples of stability theory, including orbital stability of the KdV solitary wave, and asymptotic stability of viscous shocks for scalar conservation laws, are treated in a textbook fashion for the first time. It presents spectral theory from a dynamical systems and functional analytic point of view, including essential and absolute spectra, and develops general nonlinear stability results for dissipative and Hamiltonian systems. The structure of the linear eigenvalue problem for Hamiltonian systems is carefully developed, including the Krein signature and related stability indices. The Evans function for the detection of point spectra is carefully developed through a series of frameworks of increasing complexity. Applications of the Evans function to the Orientation index, edge bifurcations, and large domain limits are developed through illustrative examples. The book is intended for first or second year graduate students in mathematics, or those with equivalent mathematical maturity. It is highly illustrated and there are many exercises scattered throughout the text that highlight and emphasize the key concepts. Upon completion of the book, the reader will be in an excellent position to understand and contribute to current research in nonlinear stability --",

In this sweeping examination, Stephen Kellert describes the basic principles, practices, and options for successfully implementing biophilic design. He shows us what is-and isn't-good biophilic design using examples of workplaces, healthcare facilities, schools, commercial centers, religious structures, and hospitality settings. This book will to appeal to architects, designers, engineers, scholars of human evolutionary biology, and-with more than one hundred striking images of designs-anyone interested in nature-inspired spaces.\"--"

Truly a flying luxury liner, the \"Hindenburg\" was the largest object ever launched in the air and her spectacular destruction on May 6th, 1937, marked the end of airship travel. This book looks at Germany's titanic airship and the other silver giants that once silently crossed the skies. It chronicles the great dirigibles, from the pioneering efforts of Count Zeppelin to the years between the wars when the United States and Great Britain competed with Germany for the prestige of building the world's most advanced airships. British hopes of airship flights spanning the empire had ended before the \"Hindenburg\" disaster with the crash of the R101 in a French field.",

Desiderata still remaining are also named by the author.Each essay is preceded by a short introduction, serving to place the indivdual articles and thoughts in a broader perspective of autobiography, both in respect to scientific and personal development of the author.

Furthermore, Kahn’s highly ambiguous epistemology with regard to man’s position within and beyond nature is being discussed – ultimately promoting an ecologically sound down to earth approach, which takes into account the impulse of the primitive and elemental. Aspiring for an eternal expression, the manifestation of the world of the human spirit was for Kahn – one of the most legendary and original architects of the 20th century – only possible within the larger order of the universe, whereas the same transcendent, creative joy pervaded both.",

            "Klappentext: \"One of the most troubling but least studied features of mass political violence is why violence often recurs in the same place over long periods of time. Douglas Kammen explores this pattern in Three Centuries of Conflict in East Timor, studying that region's tragic past, focusing on the small district of Maubara. Once a small but powerful kingdom embedded in long-distance networks of trade, over the course of three centuries the people of Maubara experienced benevolent but precarious Dutch suzerainty, Portuguese colonialism punctuated by multiple uprisings and destructive campaigns of pacification, Japanese military rule, and years of brutal Indonesian occupation. In 1999 Maubara was the site of particularly severe violence before and after the UN-sponsored referendum that finally led to the restoration of East Timor's independence. Beginning with the mystery of paired murders during East Timor's failed decolonization in 1975 and the final flurry of state-sponsored violence in 1999, Kammen combines an archival trail and rich oral interviews to reconstruct the history of the leading families of Maubara from 1712 until 2012. Kammen illuminates how recurrent episodes of mass violence shaped alliances and enmities within Maubara as well as with supra-local actors, and how those legacies have influenced efforts to address human rights violations, post-conflict reconstruction, and the relationship between local experience and the identification with the East Timorese nation. The questions posed in Three Centuries of Conflict in East Timor about recurring violence and local narratives apply to many other places besides East Timor--from the Caucasus to central Africa, and from the Balkans to China--where mass violence keeps recurring\"--",

            "This monograph presents a technique, developed by the author, to design asymptotically exponentially stabilizing finite-dimensional boundary proportional-type feedback controllers for nonlinear parabolic-type equations. The potential control applications of this technique are wide ranging in many research areas, such as Newtonian fluid flows modeled by the Navier-Stokes equations; electrically conducted fluid flows; phase separation modeled by the Cahn-Hilliard equations; and deterministic or stochastic semi-linear heat equations arising in biology, chemistry, and population dynamics modeling. The text provides answers to the following problems, which are of great practical importance: Designing the feedback law using a minimal set of eigenfunctions of the linear operator obtained from the linearized equation around the target state Designing observers for the considered control systems Constructing time-discrete controllers requiring only partial knowledge of the state After reviewing standard notations and results in functional analysis, linear algebra, probability theory and PDEs, the author describes his novel stabilization algorithm. He then demonstrates how this abstract model can be applied to stabilization problems involving magnetohydrodynamic equations, stochastic PDEs, nonsteady-states, and more. Boundary Stabilization of Parabolic Equations will be of particular interest to researchers in control theory and engineers whose work involves systems control. Familiarity with linear algebra, operator theory, functional analysis, partial differential equations, and stochastic partial differential equations is required"

            "This book provides a comprehensive introduction to ferroics and frustrated materials. Ferroics comprise a range of materials classes with functionalities such as magnetism, polarization, and orbital degrees of freedom and strain. Frustration, due to geometrical constraints, and disorder, due to chemical and/or structural inhomogeneities, can lead to glassy behavior, which has either been directly observed or inferred in a range of materials classes from model systems such as artificial spin ice, shape memory alloys, and ferroelectrics to electronically functional materials such as manganites. Interesting and unusual properties are found to be associated with these glasses and have potential for novel applications. Just as in prototypical spin glass and structural glasses, the elements of frustration and disorder lead to non-ergodocity, history dependence, frequency dependent relaxation behavior, and the presence of inhomogeneous nano clusters or domains. In addition, there are new states of matter, such as spin ice; however, it is still an open question as to whether these systems belong to the same family or universality class. The purpose of this work is to collect in a single volume the range of materials systems with differing functionalities that show many of the common characteristics of geometrical frustration, where interacting degrees of freedom do not fit in a lattice or medium, and glassy behavior is accompanied by additional presence of disorder. The chapters are written by experts in their fields and span experiment and theory, as well as simulations. Frustrated Materials and Ferroic Glasses will be of interest to a wide range of readers in condensed matter physics and materials science. Brings together experts in glasses, geometrical frustration, and functional materials Covers theory, experiment, and simulations of ferroics Features an easy-to-read introduction in each chapter to make specialized topics accessible to a broad readership in condensed matter physics and materials science"

The most common boundary layers appear in fluid mechanics, e.g., the flow of air around an airfoil or a whole airplane, or the flow of air around a car. Also in many instances in geophysical fluid mechanics, like the interface of air and earth, or air and ocean. This self-contained monograph is devoted to the study of certain classes of singular perturbation problems mostly related to thermic, fluid mechanics and optics and where mostly elliptic or parabolic equations in a bounded domain are considered. This book is a fairly unique resource regarding the rigorous mathematical treatment of boundary layer problems. The explicit methodology developed in this book extends in many different directions the concept of correctors initially introduced by J. L. Lions, and in particular the lower- and higher-order error estimates of asymptotic expansions are obtained in the setting of functional analysis. The review of differential geometry and treatment of boundary layers in a curved domain is an additional strength of this book. In the context of fluid mechanics, the outstanding open problem of the vanishing viscosity limit of the Navier-Stokes equations is investigated in this book and solved for a number of particular, but physically relevant cases. This book will serve as a unique resource for those studying singular perturbations and boundary layer problems at the advanced graduate level in mathematics or applied mathematics and may be useful for practitioners in other related fields in science and engineering such as aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, geophysical fluid mechanics, acoustics and optics"

The dependence of the most important performance characteristics of such a system on the external parameters is investigated neglecting technical and mechanical limitations. In this way, qualitative and quantitative statements for all possible configurations and envisaged applications can be derived and should be considered in the detailed planning of such facilities. For this purpose, different scenarios are considered that place completely different requirements on the design of the target station. The central statements derived in this thesis can be transferred to any framework conditions, such as different accelerator energies, so that these results can be used in the development of other neutron sources, which together with the HBS form a European network and provide a prosperous community in neutron science"

But how does the architecture of museums affect our experience as visitors? This book proposes that by seeing space as common ground between architecture and museology, and so between the museum building and its display, we can illuminate the individuality of each museum and the distinctive experience it offers - for example, how some museums create a sense of personal exploration, while others are more intensely didactic, and how the visit in some cases is transformed into a spatial experience and in other cases into a more social event.\"--",

For more than five hundred years the success or failure of nations has been determined by a country's ability to acquire knowledge and technical skill and transform them into strength and prosperity. Leading historian Jeremy Black approaches global history from a distinctive perspective, focusing on the relationship between information and society and demonstrating how the understanding and use of information have been the primary factors in the development and character of the modern age. Black suggests that the West's ascension was a direct result of its institutions and social practices for acquiring, employing, and retaining information and the technology that was ultimately produced. His cogent and well-reasoned analysis looks at cartography and the hardware of communication, armaments and sea power, mercantilism and imperialism, science and astronomy, as well as bureaucracy and the management of information, linking the history of technology with the history of global power while providing important indicators for the future of our world\"--",

        "abstract": "\"The second edition of the Urban Design Reader draws together the very best of classic and contemporary writings to illuminate and expand the theory and practice of urban design. Nearly fifty generous selections include seminal contributions from Howard, Le Corbusier, Lynch and Jacobs to more recent writings by Hiller, Koolhaas and Sorkin. Following the widespread success of the first wdition of the Urban Design Reader, this updated edition continues to provide the most important historical material of the urban design field, but also introduces new topics and selections that address the myriad challenges facing designers today. The six part structure of the second edition guides the reader through the history, theory and practice of urban design. The reader is initially introduced to those classic writings that provide the historical precedents for city-making into the twentieth Century. Section two introduces the voices and ideas that were instrumental in establishing the foundations of the urban design field from the late 1950s up to the mid 1990s. These authors present a critical reading of the design professions and offer an alternative urban design agenda focused on vital and lively places. The authors in section three provide a range of urban design rationales and strategies for reinforcing local physical identity and the creation of memorable places. These selections are largely describing the outcomes of mid-century urban design and voicing concerns over the placeless quality of contemporary urbanism. The fourth part of the Reader explores key issues in urban design and development. Ideas about sprawl, density, community health, public space and everyday life are the primary focus here. Several new selections in this part of the book also highlight important international development trends in the Middle East and China. Section five presents environmental challenges faced by the built environment professions today, including recent material on landscape urbanism, sustainability, and urban resiliency. The final section examines professional practice and current debates in the field: where urban designers work, what they do, their roles, their fields of knowledge and their educational development. The section concludes with several position pieces and debates on the future of urban design practice. This book provides an essential resource for students and practitioners of urban design, drawing together important but widely dispersed writings. Section and selection introductions are provided to assist readers in understanding the context of the material, summary messages, impacts of the writing, and how they fit into the larger picture of the urban design field. \"--",

First, various visualization methods are introduced and explained. Here, the reader is presented with applications of visualization techniques to learning samples (including projection pursuit, graphical matrices, and parallel coordinate plots) as well as functions, and sets. Next, the author provides a \"toolbox\" that contains formal definitions of the methods applied in the book and then proceeds to present visualizations of classified learning samples and classified test samples. Visualization methods are applied for the initial exploration of data, to identify the correct type of classifier, and to estimate the best achievable classification error. Once identified, the classifier's properties, proper uses, and overall performance are demonstrated and measured using visualization methods. Key areas of coverage include linear methods, kernel methods, additive models and trees, boosting, support vector machines, and nearest neighbor methods In addition to providing applications to engineering and biomedicine, the author also uses financial data sets as real data examples to illustrate nonparametric function estimation.

The authors provide rigorous theoretical derivations of significant algorithms accompanied by a generous amount of qualitative discussions of the subject matter. The book documents the development of the important concepts and methods in a manner accessible to practicing engineers, graduate-level engineering students and applied mathematicians. It includes detailed examples from actual mission designs to help ease the transition from theory to practice, and also provides prototype algorithms that are readily available on the author's website. Subject matter includes both theoretical derivations and practical implementation of spacecraft attitude determination and control systems. It provides detailed derivations for attitude kinematics and dynamics, and provides detailed description of the most widely used attitude parameterization, the quaternion. This title alsoprovides a thorough treatise of attitude dynamics including Jacobian elliptical functions. It is the first known book to provide detailed derivations and explanations of state attitude determination, and gives readers real-world examples from actual working spacecraft missions. The subject matter is chosen to fill the void of existing textbooks and treatises, especially in state and dynamics attitude determination.

        "abstract": "\"This volume examines the evolving role of the city and citizenship from classical Athens through fifth-century Rome and medieval Byzantium. Beginning in the first century CE, the universal claims of Hellenistic and Roman imperialism began to be challenged by the growing role of Christianity in shaping the primary allegiances and identities of citizens. An international team of scholars considers the extent of urban transformation, and with it, of cultural and civic identity, as practices and institutions associated with the city-state came to be replaced by those of the Christian community. The twelve essays gathered here develop an innovative research agenda by asking new questions: What was the effect on political ideology and civic identity of the transition from the city culture of the ancient world to the ruralized systems of the middle ages? How did perceptions of empire and oikoumene respond to changed political circumstances? How did Christianity redefine the context of citizenship?\"--",

        "abstract": "The NACTO Urban Street Design Guide shows how streets of every size can be reimagined and reoriented to prioritize safe driving and transit, biking, walking, and public activity. Unlike older, more conservative engineering manuals, this design guide emphasizes the core principle that urban streets are public places and have a larger role to play in communities than solely being conduits for traffic. The well-illustrated guide offers blueprints of street design from multiple perspectives, from the birds eye view to granular details. Case studies from around the country clearly show how to implement best practices, as well as provide guidance for customizing design applications to a citys unique needs. Urban Street Design Guide outlines five goals and tenets of world-class street design: Streets are public spaces. Streets play a much larger role in the public life of cities and communities than just thoroughfares for traffic. Great streets are great for business. Well-designed streets generate higher revenues for businesses and higher values for homeowners. Design for safety. Traffic engineers can and should design streets where people walking, parking, shopping, bicycling, working, and driving can cross paths safely. Streets can be changed. Transportation engineers can work flexibly within the building envelope of a street. Many city streets were created in a different era and need to be reconfigured to meet new needs. Act now! Implement projects quickly using temporary materials to help inform public decision making. Elaborating on these fundamental principles, the guide offers substantive direction for cities seeking to improve street design to create more inclusive, multi-modal urban environments. It is an exceptional resource for redesigning streets to serve the needs of 21st century cities, whose residents and visitors demand a variety of transportation options, safer streets, and vibrant community life.--",

            "\"Preface Over the decades, much of the literature has focused on the biology and ecological aspects of algae found in freshwater, marine, and brackish environments. These organisms are also known to inhabit various other environments on Earth. More recently, there has been a substantial shift toward the concept of sustainable development and the \"green economy\" with emphasis on exploiting biological systems for the benefit of mankind. This underpins the fundamentals of the field of biotechnology, which has revolutionized various fields including agriculture, food, pharmaceutical and medical sciences, environmental sciences, and industrial feedstock, thus positively impacting most spheres of human endeavor. Algae--but more specifically, microalgae--have been associated with problematic events such as algal blooms caused by eutrophication of aquatic environments and in some cases the toxins produced have serious health impacts on the aquatic environment, plants, animals, and humans. However, these events are largely due to human activities resulting in the proliferation of nutrients in aquatic environments. The significance of algae cannot be underestimated as they contribute to approximately 40% of the oxygen in the atmosphere, are the original source of fossil fuels, and are the primary producers in the oceans. Therefore, there is potential for exploitation of this invaluable biomass source that could lead to definite environmental and economic benefits for man\"--",

This book is the first to provide a comprehensive review of past and contemporary research on the Earth's inner core from a seismological perspective. Chapters cover the collection, processing and interpretation of seismological data, as well as our current knowledge of the structure, anisotropy, attenuation, rotational dynamics, and boundary of the inner core. Reviewing the latest research and suggesting new seismological techniques and future avenues, it is an essential resource for both seismologists and non-seismologists interested in this fascinating field of research. It will also form a useful resource for courses in seismology and deep Earth processes\"--"

        "abstract": "Alexander von Humboldt, whose marble features greet visitors to Berlin's Humboldt University, was the most admired scientist of his day. But the achievements for which he was most celebrated in his own lifetime were never quite perfect. When he climbed the Chimborazo, at the time believed to be the highest mountain in the world, he did not quite reach the top; he established the existence of the Casiquiare canal, between the great water systems of the Orinoco and the Amazon, but this had been well known to local people. Cosmos, the immense work meant to give a synthetic account of the natural world, was left unfinished. This was not accidental. Humboldt's pursuit of an all-encompassing, immersive approach to science was a way of finding limits: of nature and of the scientist's own self. A Longing for Wide and Unknown Things portrays a scientific life lived in the era of German Romanticism -- a time of radical change, in which new ways of living seemed possible. Humboldt's travels in South America were motivated both by scientific curiosity and by other desires that are less easily identified.0As he himself admitted, he 'would have sailed to the remotest South Seas, even if it hadn't fulfilled any scientific purpose whatever'",

In the aftermath of the civil wars Augustus continued to provide for his physical safety in the same way as in the old Republic while, at the same time, overturning the taboo of armed men in the city. During the Augustan age, the division of the city into 14 regions and 265 vici was designed to establish control over the urban space. Augustus' successors consolidated his policy but the specific roles of the various military or paramilitary forces remain a matter for debate. Drawing on the testimony of ancient authors such as Tacitus and Suetonius and on material evidence, the volume examines both the circumstances in which these forces intervened and the strategies that they adopted. It also examines the pre-Augustan, Augustan and post-Augustan sense of 'securitas', both as a philosophical and a political concept. The final section expands the focus from the city of Rome to the Italian peninsula where the security of the emperor as he travelled to his country residences required advance planning and implementation.\"--Back cover",

            "The information age owes its existence to a little-known but crucial development, the theoretical study of logic and the foundations of mathematics. The Great Formal Machinery Works draws on original sources and rare archival materials to trace the history of the theories of deduction and computation that laid the logical foundations for the digital revolution. Jan von Plato examines the contributions of figures such as Aristotle; the nineteenth-century German polymath Hermann Grassmann; George Boole, whose Boolean logic would prove essential to programming languages and computing; Ernst Schröder, best known for his work on algebraic logic; and Giuseppe Peano, cofounder of mathematical logic. Von Plato shows how the idea of a formal proof in mathematics emerged gradually in the second half of the nineteenth century, hand in hand with the notion of a formal process of computation. A turning point was reached by 1930, when Kurt Gödel conceived his celebrated incompleteness theorems. They were an enormous boost to the study of formal languages and computability, which were brought to perfection by the end of the 1930s with precise theories of formal languages and formal deduction and parallel theories of algorithmic computability. Von Plato describes how the first theoretical ideas of a computer soon emerged in the work of Alan Turing in 1936 and John von Neumann some years later.--Jacket",

He looks at the organisation of alternative forms of housing—from Copenhagen’s Freetown Christiana to the squats of the Lower East Side—as well as the official response, including the recent criminalisation of squatting, the brutal eviction of squatters and their widespread vilification. Pictured as a way to reimagine and reclaim the city, squatting offers an alternative to housing insecurity, oppressive property speculation and the negative effects of urban regeneration.

This book introduces a new general methodology to solve the GMP when its data are polynomials and basic semi-algebraic sets. This methodology combines semidefinite programming with recent results from real algebraic geometry to provide a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations converging to the desired optimal value. Applied on appropriate cones, standard duality in convex optimization nicely expresses the duality between moments and positive polynomials. In the second part, the methodology is particularized and described in detail for various applications, including global optimization, probability, optimal control, mathematical finance, multivariate integration, etc., and examples are provided for each particular application.\" -- Book cover",

Nitrates result in the contamination of drinking water and produce the risk of the \"blue-baby\" syndrome in infants and of stomach cancer in adults. Agriculture produces methane, ammonia, nitrous oxide and the products of buring off, all of which add to the world's problems of acid rain, depletion of the ozone layer and global warming. This book, which focusses on the UK, the USA and Third World countries, is the first comprehensive review of agriculture and pollution, it examines the facts and assesses the relative dangers of each pollution problem. It also considers the effects of pollution on agriculture itself, crop yields are depressed and livestock damaged by various forms of pollution from all sources.

It does not just explain the synthesis of bulk nanocomposite materials, but goes a step further in describing the application of nanotechnology. Foams generated with polymer nanocomposite materials have a variety of applications in many fields, including automotive, packaging, and insulation. The use of nanocomposites in the formation of foams enhances property profiles like porosity control, strength, and stiffness significantly, which enables the application of such materials ranging from conventional to more advanced areas. Information on various polymer nanocomposite foams has previously been available mainly in the form of research studies, and a comprehensive book describing these materials and their technologies has not been available. This book compiles advances in the various aspects of nanocomposite foams to provide background information to readers new to this field, as well as to serve as a reference text for researchers in this area. \"--",

        "abstract": "Wherever You Find People' captures the compelling story of the Integrated Centres of Public Education (CIEP) in the Brazilian city and federal state of Rio de Janeiro. This unique but relatively obscure experimental educational project is a prime example of socially driven public architecture and a testament to ambition and forward thinking. The CIEPs were conceived in 1982 by Rio's State Governor Leonel Brizola (1922-2004), the anthropologist, author and politician Darcy Ribeiro (1922-97), and the eminent architect Oscar Niemeyer (1907-2012). Today a network of 508 CIEPs covers the entire state of Rio wherever you find people, you will find a CIEP. This new book is based on extensive interviews with key protagonists and richly illustrated with original sketches and annotated drawings from the Oscar Niemeyer Foundation archive, alongside visuals by Aberrant Architecture. It also features new essays illustrating how architecture can embrace the constraints and conditions of the modern world and engage creatively with the reality of today's social, political, legislative and economic boundaries.0'Wherever You Find People' contributes to a wider architectural discourse about the links between education, design and school building",

For readers new to linear models, the book helps them see the big picture.

Along with describing common applications of GLMMs, the text introduces the essential theory and main methodology associated with linear models that accommodate random model effects and non-Gaussian data. Unlike traditional linear model textbooks that focus on normally distributed data, this one adopts a generalized mixed model approach throughout: data for linear modeling need not be normally distributed and effects may be fixed or random. With numerous examples using SAS® PROC GLIMMIX, this book is ideal for graduate students in statistics, statistics professionals seeking to update their knowledge, and researchers new to the generalized linear model thought process. It focuses on data-driven processes and provides context for extending traditional linear model thinking to generalized linear mixed modeling\"--",

        "abstract": "The Power of Place explores the nature of power--the power of kings, emperors, and popes--through the places that these rulers created or developed, including palaces, cities, landscapes, holy places, inauguration sites, and burial places. Ranging across all of Europe from the first to the sixteenth centuries--from Prague and Seville to Palermo and the Oslo Fjord--David Rollason examines how these places conveyed messages of power and what those messages were. Rollason draws on the latest research in a range of disciplines--principally archaeology, and the histories of art, architecture, and landscape, as well as historical and literary studies--to investigate what the power of rulers consisted of. Was their power based on impersonal bureaucratic mechanisms, on personal relationships between rulers and subjects, or on strong beliefs in the quasi-divine status of rulers? How did impressive edifices support and emphasize these practices of power? Rollason takes readers to spectacular sites, including the remarkable remains of the tenth-century city of Madinat al-Zahra near Cordoba, the remarkably preserved palace-church of the emperor Charlemagne in Aachen, and the soaring shrine-church of the Saint-Chapelle of King Louis IX. Giving readers the tools to analyze rulers' palaces, landscapes, cities, and holy places, The Power of Place offers a fascinating perspective on the development of power throughout history.",

The JCF of a linear transformation, or of a matrix, encodes all of the structural information about that linear transformation, or matrix. This book is a careful development of JCF. After beginning with background material, we introduce Jordan Canonical Form and related notions: eigenvalues, (generalized) eigenvectors, and the characteristic and minimum polynomials.We decide the question of diagonalizability, and prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. Then we present a careful and complete proof of the fundamental theorem: Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over the field of complex numbers C, and let T : V -. V be a linear transformation. Then T has a Jordan Canonical Form. This theorem has an equivalent statement in terms of matrices: Let A be a square matrix with complex entries. Then A is similar to a matrix J in Jordan Canonical Form, i.e., there is an invertible matrix P and a matrix J in Jordan Canonical Form with A = PJP-1.We further present an algorithm to find P and J , assuming that one can factor the characteristic polynomial of A. In developing this algorithm we introduce the eigenstructure picture (ESP) of a matrix, a pictorial representation that makes JCF clear. The ESP of A determines J , and a refinement, the labelled eigenstructure picture (ESP) of A, determines P as well.We illustrate this algorithm with copious examples, and provide numerous exercises for the reader",

            "\"Preface: What Is This Book About? The main objective of this book is to provide a practical guide to business and IT leaders who want to improve IT capability to better serve the business. By this, we mean the ability for IT teams to improve the pace at which software applications can be delivered, not just on one Agile pilot project but on all IT projects. But there lies the difficulty for IT management to make the leap from doing Agile or Kanban (Lean) on one project to an IT-wide effort, which requires much more than just deploying some Agile techniques to a few people. Likewise, rather than blindly deploy Agile to the entire IT organization in a one-size-fits-all approach, we also show in this book how IT and business management can work together to determine business goals that can drive this IT-wide undertaking. IT improvement may also require leverage of Kanban (Lean), rather than of Agile alone, to improve it's ability to deliver better and faster applications on a large scale. While we make no claim that what we mention in this book is the best or the only way to introduce change programs into a company, everything in this book comes from our experience in software project management and software delivery in the trenches within companies of different sizes. To make things easier for the busy IT leader and executive, we have constructed and included in this book a few case studies, with the intent to illustrate ideas or principles. All resemblance to a specific, real-life event or character is, therefore, purely coincidental. It is, as always, up to the readers to devise approaches and ideas that will make the most sense in their specific situation. K15472.indb 19 6/15/12 2:10 PM xx ?

            "In the context of globalisation and demographic change, the internationalisation of society is becoming increasingly important. In this anthology, awareness is raised for this topic. Its first part deals with the “spatial construction through migrants”, focusing on the culturally differentiated construction of spaces and landscapes from a theoretical point of view. From a social perspective, the shifts in such needs/requirements and values that people tie to different parts of their spatial environment are of particular interest. For example, identity constructions underlie a growing erosion process due to globalisation processes, as regards the understanding of space and landscape as well as their acquisition. Thus, the different levels of spatial planning are confronted with further differentiated demands in terms of space and landscape, implying major challenges for planners. Based on different case studies, the anthology’s second part “migration and specific spaces” follows these theoretical considerations and reflects spatial demands of migrants and their potential of internationalisation. The selected case studies mainly deal with rural areas as well as the internationalisation in those cities which has not attracted academic attention until now. At first, the focus is on the investigation of spatial acquisitions and demands of US-American, Muslim and Turkish migrants. Then, the housing situation of migrants is analysed, including the cross-border commuters at the German-Luxembourgish border. The following part is devoted to the potential which can be generated by the increasing internationalisation of the society. This is done on the one hand with a theoretical example of identity, home as well as inclusion and exclusion. On the other hand identities and self-attributions of repatriates from former Soviet Union in Rhineland-Palatinate are discussed. The conclusion, based on the different articles of this volume, discusses recommendations for the future spatial development that arise in the course of internationalisation of society.",
            "Die Internationalisierung der Gesellschaft gewinnt im Zuge der Globalisierung sowie des demographischen Wandels zunehmend an Bedeutung, weshalb der vorliegende Sammelband für dieses Thema sensibilisieren möchte. So wird in einem ersten Teil der Themenbereich \"Raumkonstruktionen durch Migrantinnen und Migranten\" behandelt, der sich auf theoretischer Ebene mit der kulturell differenzierten Konstruktion von Räumen und Landschaften auseinandersetzt. Aus gesellschaftlicher Sicht sind vor allem Verschiebungen solcher Bedarfe/Anforderungen und Werte von Interesse, die Menschen an verschiedene Teile ihrer räumlichen Umgebung knüpfen. So unterliegen Identitätskonstrukte beispielsweise vor dem Hintergrund der Globalisierung einem zunehmenden Erosionsprozess, der auch die Verständnisse von Raum und Landschaft, aber auch deren Aneignung betrifft. Auf diese Weise werden die unterschiedlichen Ebenen der räumlichen Planung mit weiter differenzierten Ansprüchen an Raum und Landschaft konfrontiert, was sie vor große Herausforderungen stellt. An die theoretische Betrachtung schließt sich der zweite Themenbereich \"Migration und spezifische Räume\" an, der anhand von unterschiedlichen Fallstudien den Raumanspruch von Migrantinnen und Migranten sowie die Potenziale der Internationalisierung aufzeigt. Die ausgewählten Fallbeispiele beschäftigen sich vor allem mit den ländlichen Räumen sowie der Internationalisierung in bisher weniger im Fokus der Wissenschaft stehenden Städten. Dabei werden zunächst Raumaneignung und Raumansprüche US-amerikanischer, muslimischer und türkischer Migrantinnen und Migranten untersucht. Danach steht die Wohnsituation der Migrantinnen und Migranten im Zentrum, wobei auch auf die Grenzgänger im deutsch-luxemburgischen Grenzraum eingegangen wird. Der folgende Teil widmet sich den Potenzialen, die mit der zunehmenden Internationalisierung der Gesellschaft einhergehen können. Dies geschieht zum einen theoretisch am Beispiel von Identität, Heimat sowie In- und Exklusion. Zum anderen werden beispielhaft Identitäten und Selbstzuschreibungen von (Spät-)Aussiedlern in Rheinland-Pfalz thematisiert. Abschließend werden aus den einzelnen Beiträgen Handlungsempfehlungen abgeleitet und diskutiert, die sich im Zuge der Internationalisierung der Gesellschaft für die zukünftige Raumentwicklung ergeben."

Millions of tons of wood and forest biomass are harvested each year and converted to construction materials, commodity products, specialty chemicals, and fuel. We may have long taken for granted this invaluable natural resource bestowed on us through photosynthesis, partly because we have indulged in petroleum-based products and energy for over a century. Concerns over depletion of fossil fuel and global climate change drive us to search for alternative sources of energy that are sustainable and have less environmental impacts than petroleum. Although we have a number of potential options, forest biomass stands out because of (1) a vibrant forest products industry that is equipped with efficient infrastructures, logistics, and highly skilled human capital and (2) the potential for replacing the entire spectrum of petroleum-based products and chemicals with renewable materials and chemicals from forest biomass",

Tradition and Invention in Architecture brings together 26 of Stern's essays and conversations from the past five decades. Topics range from modern classicism, American housing, gardens, and New York City to the work of Norman Foster, Louis Kahn, Charles Moore, and Robert Moses. Reminders of Stern's own broad career in architecture are found in his thoughts on his PBS television series Pride of Place, his discussion of the planning of Seaside and Celebration, Florida, and his view on institutional branding through architecture. Known as much for his candor as for his profound knowledge of American architecture, Stern's observations on the architecture of his time are equally valuable. As he writes, \"For an architect, writing is one way of reconsidering history while working in the present--always in search of the best from the past and the present, which allows us to invent for the future",

        "abstract": "Britain was the first country to exploit atomic energy on a large scale, and at its peak in the mid-1960s, it had generated more electricity from nuclear power than the rest of the world combined. The civil atomic energy programme grew out of the military programme which produced plutonium for atomic weapons. In 1956, Calder Hall power station was opened by the Queen. The very next year, one of the early Windscale reactors caught fire and the world's first major nuclear accident occurred. The civil programme ran into further difficulty in the mid-1960s and as a consequence of procrastination in the decision-making process, the programme lost momentum and effectively died. No nuclear power stations have been built since Sizewell B in the late 1980s. This book presents a study of Government papers that have recently become available in the public domain. For the first time in history, the research reactor programme is presented in detail, along with a study of the decision-making by the Government, the Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), and the Central Electricity Board (CEGB). This book is aimed at both specialists in nuclear power and the interested public as a technical history on the development and ultimate failure of the British atomic energy programme",

Economic, social, political and biological systems are all said to be in trouble. Moreover, there is a limited window of opportunity for dealing with the problem. At the same time the public around the globe is mostly apathetic. Even in countries such as Norway where high levels of environmental concern and political involvement are the norm, climate change often seems more like \"background noise\" than a problem demanding radical collective action (Norgaard 2011). Contrary to what one might think, a similar situation pertains in the United States. Here, despite an effective right-wing campaign to discredit climate science (Oreskes and Conway 2010), surveys now show that a majority of people believe that climate change is happening and needs to be addressed, including, now, a majority of Republicans (Maibach et al 2013).

In each case the doctor Chris Engels was involved, either as the client or as a consultant. Aside from his medical practice, Engels was a poet and a painter. A firm friendship would grow between the two men. In \"Rietveld & Curaçao\", Jan de Heer documents in the greatest detail Rietveld's entire body of work in Curaçao, culminating in the Monsignor Verriet Institute. He also sheds light on the remarkable relationship between Rietveld and Engels. The book places Rietveld's projects within the island's cultural and political development. Rietveld managed to incorporate the climatological conditions of Curaçao in his designs to great effect. He turned the trade winds to his advantage in the Verriet Institute, the Richardus House and the design of Engels's own residence, introduced adjustable shutters instead of fixed walls and used large roof overhangs to keep out the direct glare of the sun. In the Verriet Institute he turned the roof into one large gutter to catch the precious rainwater. It is for these reasons that Rietveld's designs have remained an inspirational example for Curaçaoan architectural practice to this day.--Publisher's website",

The idea that the Universe we observe today originated from an enormous explosion (big bang) is now well known and widely accepted, at all levels, in modern popular culture. But what happens to the Universe before the big bang? And would it make any sense at all to ask such a question? In fact, recent progress in theoretical physics, and in particular in String Theory, suggests answers to the above questions, providing us with mathematical tools able in principle to reconstruct the history of the Universe even for times before the big bang. In the emerging cosmological scenario the Universe, at the epoch of the big bang, instead of being a 'new born baby' was actually a rather 'aged' creature in the middle of its possibly infinitely enduring evolution. The aim of this book is to convey this picture in non-technical language accessibile also to non-specialists. The author, himself a leading cosmologist, draws attention to ongoing and future observations that might reveal relics of an era before the big bang.",

            "Partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental to the modeling of natural phenomena, arising in every field of science. Consequently, the desire to understand the solutions of these equations has always had a prominent place in the efforts of mathematicians; it has inspired such diverse fields as complex function theory, functional analysis, and algebraic topology. Like algebra, topology, and rational mechanics, PDEs are a core area of mathematics. This book aims to provide the background necessary to initiate work on a Ph.D. thesis in PDEs for beginning graduate students. Prerequisites include a truly advanced calculus course and basic complex variables. Lebesgue integration is needed only in chapter 10, and the necessary tools from functional analysis are developed within the coarse. The book can be used to teach a variety of different courses. This new edition features new problems throughout, and the problems have been rearranged in each section from simplest to most difficult. New examples have also been added. The material on Sobolev spaces has been rearranged and expanded. A new section on nonlinear variational problems with \"Young-measure\" solutions appears. The reference section has also been expanded."

            "Welcome to your study of enzyme kinetics, the subject that underlies all enzymology, which in turn underlies all aspects of biochemistry. This text will give you an introduction to a wide range of topics that constitute the modern enzyme kinetics. This textbook is directed at graduate students in biochemistry, chemistry, and life sciences, for advanced courses in enzyme kinetics, enzymology, and enzyme chemistry. For this reason, the whole book is organized in a systematic and scholarly fashion. It is unlikely that the student will be expected to cover everything in the text, but in a later career she or he may find it an invaluable reference for topics that are needed in practice. The concepts, definitions and detailed algebra of enzyme kinetics are laid out in accurate detail. For that reason, this textbook can also serve as a handbook for enzyme kinetics for research workers in the field. The research worker will find it a useful source, which can be used for solving the daily experimental problems in the laboratory. The preparation of the manuscript for this book was under the constant surveillance of W. Wallace Cleland, Professor of Chemical Science at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and one of the founders of modern enzyme kinetics. Without his help and advice, this bookwould not be possible. Several versions of the manuscript were constantly corrected and improved by Svetlana Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Novi Sad.",

            "In this book, Kevin McCrimmon describes the history of Jordan Algebras and he describes in full mathematical detail the recent structure theory for Jordan algebras of arbitrary dimension due to Efim Zel'manov. To keep the exposition elementary, the structure theory is developed for linear Jordan algebras, though the modern quadratic methods are used throughout. Both the quadratic methods and the Zelmanov results go beyond the previous textbooks on Jordan theory, written in the 1960's and 1980's before the theory reached its final form. This book is intended for graduate students and for individuals wishing to learn more about Jordan algebras. No previous knowledge is required beyond the standard first-year graduate algebra course. General students of algebra can profit from exposure to nonassociative algebras, and students or professional mathematicians working in areas such as Lie algebras, differential geometry, functional analysis, or exceptional groups and geometry can also profit from acquaintance with the material. Jordan algebras crop up in many surprising settings and can be applied to a variety of mathematical areas. Kevin McCrimmon introduced the concept of a quadratic Jordan algebra and developed a structure theory of Jordan algebras over an arbitrary ring of scalars. He is a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Virginia and the author of more than 100 research papers."

            "Mathematics is often regarded as the study of calculation, but in fact, mathematics is much more. It combines creativity and logic in order to arrive at abstract truths. This book is intended to illustrate how calculation, creativity, and logic can be combined to solve a range of problems in algebra. Originally conceived as a text for a course for future secondary-school mathematics teachers, this book has developed into one that could serve well in an undergraduate course in abstract algebra or a course designed as an introduction to higher mathematics. Not all topics in a traditional algebra course are covered. Rather, the author focuses on integers, polynomials, their ring structure, and fields, with the aim that students master a small number of serious mathematical ideas. The topics studied should be of interest to all mathematics students and are especially appropriate for future teachers. One nonstandard feature of the book is the small number of theorems for which full proofs are given. Many proofs are left as exercises, and for almost every such exercise a detailed hint or outline of the proof is provided. These exercises form the heart of the text. Unwinding the meaning of the hint or outline can be a significant challenge, and the unwinding process serves as the catalyst for learning. Ron Irving is the Divisional Dean of Natural Sciences at the University of Washington. Prior to assuming this position, he served as Chair of the Department of Mathematics. He has published research articles in several areas of algebra, including ring theory and the representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. In 2001, he received the University of Washington's Distinguished Teaching Award for the course on which this book is based.",

        "abstract": "In the densely populised Low Countries, with their powerful and self-conscious cities, historical consciousness was expressed in various ways. Cases of regional historiography have been well-studied, but more local instances of historiographical production have remained more or less unnoticed. In ten articles with an extensive introduction, this volume places the local historiography in this region in a European perspective. It brings to the attention new material from a wide variety of cities and sets the standard for future research.0This volume aims at taking the first steps towards a revaluation of urban historiography in Northwest Europe, including rather than excluding texts that do not fit common definitions. It confronts examples from the Low Countries to well-studied cases abroad, in order to develop new approaches to urban historiography in general. In the authors' view, there are no fixed textual formats, social or political categories, or material forms that exclusively define ?the urban chronicle?. Urban historiography in pre-modern Western Europe came in many guises, from the dry and modest historical notes in a guild register, to the elaborate heraldic images in a luxury manuscript made on commission for a patrician family, to the legally founded political narrative of a professional scribe in an official town chronicle. The contributions in this volume attest to the diversity of the ?genre? and look more closely at these texts from a broader, comparative perspective, unrestrained by typologies and genre definitions. It is mainly because of these hybrid guises, that many examples of urban historiography from the Low Countries for instance succeeded in going unnoticed for a considerable amount of time",

        "abstract": "\"The far side of the Moon, also called the \"\"dark side of the Moon\"\" was unknown to humanity until the Luna and Lunar Orbiter pictures were returned to Earth. Even since then, its nature has puzzled researchers. Now we know that a giant impact struck the near side with such force that it created the near side megabasin , opening the way for floods of mare and sending vast amounts of ejecta to the far side. The Far Side of the Moon explains this event and also documents the appearance of the features of the far side with beautiful pictures from Lunar Orbiter. As in the previous volume, The Lunar Orbiter Photographic Atlas of the Near Side of the Moon, the author has taken the original images and cleaned them of system artefacts using modern digital image processing. The best photographic coverage of the far side of the Moon has been the 150 photos taken by the Lunar Orbiter series. The other sources are pictures taken by the Apollo Command Module, which were limited to the equatorial regions, and the Clementine mission, which took pictures at a high sun angle that washed out the topography of the features. Until now, the far side Lunar Orbiter photos have only been available with strong reconstruction lines, but appear here for the first time as complete photographs, unmarred by imaging and processing artefacts. Also, this is the first book to explain in detail how the far side was deeply covered by ejecta from the Near Side Megabasin and modified by later impacts. A CD-R accompanies the book, and contains all the enhanced and cleaned photographs for use by the reader in screen viewing, lectures, etc..\"",

        "abstract": "Atmospheric particles are ubiquitous in the atmosphere: they form the seeds for cloud droplets and they form haze layers, blocking out incoming radiation and contributing to a partial cooling of our climate. They also contribute to poor air quality and health impacts. A large fraction of aerosols are formed from nucleation processes - that is a phase transition from vapour to liquid or solid particles. Examples are the formation of stable clusters about 1 nm in size from molecular collisions and these in turn can grow into larger (100 nm or more) haze particles via condensation to the formation of ice crystals in mixed phase or cold clouds. This book brings together the leading experts from the nucleation and atmospheric aerosols research communities to present the current state-of-the-art knowledge in these related fields. Topics covered are: Nucleation Experiment  Theory, Binary, Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Nucleation, Ion  Cluster Properties During Nucleation, Aerosol Characterisation  Properties, Aerosol Formation, Dynamics and Growth, Marine Aerosol Production, Aerosol-Cloud Interactions, Chemical Composition  Cloud Drop Activation, Remote Sensing of aerosol  clouds and Air Quality-Climate Interactions",

            "One of the basic ideas in differential geometry is that the study of analytic properties of certain differential operators acting on sections of vector bundles yields geometric and topological properties of the underlying base manifold. Symplectic spinor fields are sections in an L^2-Hilbert space bundle over a symplectic manifold and symplectic Dirac operators, acting on symplectic spinor fields, are associated to the symplectic manifold in a very natural way. Hence they may be expected to give interesting applications in symplectic geometry and symplectic topology. These symplectic Dirac operators are called Dirac operators, since they are defined in an analogous way as the classical Riemannian Dirac operator known from Riemannian spin geometry. They are called symplectic because they are constructed by use of the symplectic setting of the underlying symplectic manifold. This volume is the first one that gives a systematic and self-contained introduction to the theory of symplectic Dirac operators and reflects the current state of the subject. At the same time, it is intended to establish the idea that symplectic spin geometry and symplectic Dirac operators may give valuable tools in symplectic geometry and symplectic topology, which have become important fields and very active areas of mathematical research."

Firstly, it is shown that uncertainties are the consequence of modern science rather than of measurements. Secondly, it stresses the importance of the deductive approach to uncertainties. This perspective has the potential of dealing with the uncertainty of a single data point and of data of a set having differing weights. Both cases cannot be dealt with the inductive approach, which is usually taken. This innovative monograph also fully covers both uncorrelated and correlated uncertainties. The weakness of using statistical weights in regression analysis is discussed. Abundant examples are given for correlation in and between data sets and for the feedback of uncertainties on experiment design.",

The history of the central limit theorem is not only expressed in light of \"technical\" achievement, but is also tied to the intellectual scope of its advancement. The history starts with Laplace's 1810 approximation to distributions of linear combinations of large numbers of independent random variables and its modifications by Poisson, Dirichlet, and Cauchy, and it proceeds up to the discussion of limit theorems in metric spaces by Donsker and Mourier around 1950. This self-contained exposition additionally describes the historical development of analytical probability theory and its tools, such as characteristic functions or moments. The importance of historical connections between the history of analysis and the history of probability theory is demonstrated in great detail.

        "abstract": "In today's world, data must be sent around the world cheaply and securely, and that requires origin authentication, integrity protection, and confidentiality - the recipient of a message should be able to ascertain who sent the message, be sure that the message has not been changed en route, and be sure that the data arrives without having been read by anyone else. The second editor invented signcryption, an area of cryptography that studies systems that simultaneously provide origin authentication, integrity protection and confidentiality for data. Signcryption schemes combine the features of digital signature schemes with those of public-key encryption schemes and aim to provide security guarantees in a way that is provably correct and significantly less computationally expensive than the 'encrypt-then-sign' method most commonly adopted in public-key cryptography. This is the first comprehensive book on signcryption, and brings together leading authors from the field of cryptography in a discussion of the different methods for building efficient and secure signcryption schemes, and the ways in which these schemes can be used in practical systems. Chapters deal with the theory of signcryption, methods for constructing practical signcryption schemes, and the advantages of using such schemes in practical situations. The book will be of benefit to cryptography researchers, graduate students and practitioners.",

Providing a comprehensive coverage of quantized identification, the book treats linear and nonlinear systems, as well as time-invariant and time-varying systems. The authors examine independent and dependent noises, stochastic- and deterministic-bounded noises, and also noises with unknown distribution functions. The key methodologies combine empirical measures and information-theoretic approaches to derive identification algorithms, provide convergence and convergence speed, establish efficiency of estimation, and explore input design, threshold selection and adaptation, and complexity analysis.

            "Parting the Cosmic Veil describes our gradual awareness of a vast, previously concealed Universe. It is a story of expanding horizons and the discovery of invisible worlds, made possible with new technology and novel telescopes that have broadened our range of perception and sharpened our vision. Spacecraft have carried men to the Moon, and traveled throughout the Solar System, obtaining close-up views that have transformed the moons and planets from moving points of light to fascinating, diverse worlds. Modern technology has also enabled the detection of giant planets around other stars, taking us one step closer to the possible detection of life outside the Earth. Astronomers have used telescopes, operating at the visible wavelengths that we see with our eye, to reveal the true extent of the Milky Way and discover billions of remote galaxies that are rushing away from us in an expanding Universe. Each of these galaxies contains billions of stars wheeling around their massive central hub. Radio waves and X-rays, which lie beyond the range of visual perception, are used to detect a violent Universe, from exploding stars to gamma ray bursts and the Big Bang itself, with the associated discoveries of pulsars, black holes and quasars. Radio astronomers have also shown that the dark spaces between the stars contain vast tracts of cold hydrogen atoms and a host of molecules. Dark invisible matter has been discovered residing outside the shining stars and galaxies, outweighing them all. And a mysterious dark energy has also been found, which fills the nooks and crannies of seemingly empty space. The Cosmos is evolving, participating in ongoing processes of creation, destruction, and re-birth. But even though we are pushing the boundaries of knowledge closer to an understanding of the origins and destinies, of either the Universe or Life, the ultimate answers to these grand questions still lie hidden behind the Cosmic Veil. <This voyage of discovery is presented within universal themes, such as invisibility, motion, content, form, impermanence, violence and emptiness, beginnings and ends. These are topics that concern us all, helping us take the Universe personally, so each chapter begins with the human aspect of some of these themes. Parting the Cosmic Veil is additionally broadened by including the perceptions of artists, poets and writers, each example chosen for the insight it offers, as well as with line drawings that forcefully compact a scientific insight. ..."

            "Hidden from human view, accessible only to sensitive receivers attached to huge radio telescopes, giant versions of backyard satellite dishes, the invisible universe beyond our senses continues to fascinate and intrigue our imaginations. We cannot really comprehend what it means to say that a galaxy is exploding, yet that is the nature of some of the distant radio sources in the furthest reaches of space. Closer to home, in the Milky Way galaxy, radio astronomers listen patiently to the ticking of pulsars that tell of star death and states of matter of awesome densities. And between the stars, radio emission from a host of over 120 complex molecules radiate outward to reveal a tale about chemical processes that produce the very stuff of life. And all of this happens out there in the universe hidden from our eyes, even when aided by the Hubble Space Telescope. This is the story of radio astronomy, of how radio waves are generated by stars, supernova, quasars, colliding galaxies, and by the very beginnings of the universe itself. In The Invisible Universe, you learn what astronomers are doing with those huge dishes in the New Mexico desert, in a remote valley in Puerto Rico, in the green Pocahontas Valley in West Virginia, as well as dozens of other remote sites around the world. With each of these observatories, the scientists collect and analyze their data, \"listening\" to the radio signals from space, in order to learn what is out there, and perhaps even if someone else may be listening as well"

Each problem is accompanied by a detailed step-by-step solution, organized as strategy, assumptions, approximations, numerical calculation and interpretation. Solutions to the key problems (e.g. thermal equilibration, ligand-receptor interaction, aminoacid zwitterions, HOMO-LUMO gap) are accompanied by simple introductory explanations. In addition, informal notes are provided on difficult concepts, for example: entropy, reaction activation barrier, wave mechanics. Schemes, diagrams and structural formulas accompany most solutions and explanations.   Thus, this textbook may serve as a self-tutorial for undergraduate students in physical chemistry, biophysics, biochemistry, and medicinal chemistry.",

            "At some time we have all gazed through the telescope eyepiece at the magnificent rings and banded globe of Saturn, or seen long shadows reaching across crater floors at the Moon’s terminator - and wondered at the sheer beauty of the sight. It seems almost anachronistic to think of sketching when CCD imaging is available, but astronomical sketching provides an entirely different and deeply personal experience. It means spending time at the eyepiece to really look at what you can see, training your eye to perceive ever greater detail to take the fullest advantage of your telescope's light grasp and resolution. And of course, good astronomical sketches are artwork in themselves, for display and decoration in the home or observatory. Astronomical Sketching is as an easy, step-by-step introduction to sketching celestial objects. It brings together five talented astronomical sketch artists, each of whom has a unique mastery of the media along with the ability to teach their own techniques. Here is a wealth of knowledge, tips and techniques for every aspiring astronomical artist!",

The Global Programme on Health Promotion Effectiveness (GPHPE) of the International Union for Health Promotion and Education takes on this challenge in Global Perspectives on Health Promotion Effectiveness. Fifty-five contributors representing six continents come together to analyze major programs around the world and evaluate their effectiveness. The result is a symposium in a book, the first in a series, representing the best critical thinking on crucial issues such as these: Assessment of evidence and evaluation of effectiveness in an international context. Synthesis of progress on the various GPHPE regional projects, with candid evaluations of strengths and limitations, and factors unique to each region. Advocacy to strengthen the evidence base for mental health promotion, physical activity promotion and a wide range of settings-based health promotion interventions. Challenges to health promotion and its assessment, including peace-building, urbanization, globalization, and social determinants. Global debates on emerging health promotion arenas equity, methodology, partnership, development in adverse political climates, and others as to whether or not traditional concepts of evidence, impact, and outcomes can be applied. Global Perspectives on Health Promotion Effectiveness is a significant document with profound implications for practitioners involved in implementing health promotion programs. It will serve as a vital source of frontline knowledge for researchers and students of public health.",

            "The central mathematical concept in the theory of frictionless markets is a martingale measure. In this, the first monograph devoted to the theory of financial markets with transaction costs, the authors argue that, for financial markets with proportional transaction costs, this concept should be replaced by that of the consistent price system, which is a martingale evolving in the duals to the solvency cones. Three main subjects are considered: 1. The Leland approach to the hedging of contingent claims based on approximate replication. 2. Arbitrage theory for markets with proportional transaction costs based on a geometric approach. 3. The consumption-investment problem analyzed using viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. The first part contains recent findings on hedging errors and limit theorems for Leland-type strategies. The rigorous mathematical analysis presented in the book is designed to serve as a platform for further studies. The second part includes a chapter on the arbitrage theory for frictionless markets in discrete time. It is presented as an introduction to the theory of markets with transaction costs, but can also be read independently. The main subjects of the second part are no-arbitrage criteria and hedging theorems for European and American options under transaction costs. In contrast to the classical theory, the value processes are vector-valued and the concept of the martingale measure is replaced by the concept of the consistent price system. Hedging theorems give dual descriptions of the set of initial endowments needed to super-replicate contingent claims. These descriptions are expressed in terms of consistent price systems. This volume provides a detailed study of various new phenomena arising in the presence of market friction in discrete and continuous time. The mathematics needed is a synthesis of ideas from finite-dimensional geometry, geometric functional analysis, and general theory of stochastic processes. The third part deals with the optimal control of portfolios in the presence of market friction using the geometric approach developed in the second part. It contains a study of viscosity solutions of a multidimensional HJB equation. Special attention is paid to the two-asset model, for which the structure of optimal control is described, together with findings on the asymptotic behavior of solutions for vanishing transaction costs. The appendix provides a toolbox containing auxiliary results from various branches of mathematics used in the book."

The Handbook on Cancer Survivorship responds to the diverse needs of survivors and their support communities by comprehensively addressing the major issues in the field, from the burden of survivorship to secondary prevention. Editor Michael Feuerstein, himself a cancer survivor, and sixty other top scientist-practitioners analyze in depth how survivors meet and manage the challenges of life after cancer, and what clinicians, researchers, and public health systems can do to ease the transition.

This book shows how descent methods using such gradients allow a unified treatment of a wide variety of problems in differential equations. For discrete versions of partial differential equations, corresponding Sobolev gradients are seen to be vastly more efficient than ordinary gradients. In fact, descent methods with these gradients generally scale linearly with the number of grid points, in sharp contrast with the use of ordinary gradients. Aside from the first edition of this work, this is the only known account of Sobolev gradients in book form. Most of the applications in this book have emerged since the first edition was published some twelve years ago. What remains of the first edition has been extensively revised. There are a number of plots of results from calculations and a sample MatLab code is included for a simple problem. Those working through a fair portion of the material have in the past been able to use the theory on their own applications and also gain an appreciation of the possibility of a rather comprehensive point of view on the subject of partial differential equations"

It then goes on to analyse the important role the CEECs may play as \"buffer zone\" between the current EU Member states and the other countries of Southern and Eastern Europe. Finally, it reveals what the prospective enlargement of the EU implies in terms of CEECs’ migration policies on such subjects as border control, the control of flows, labour migration, family-linked migrations, refugees and asylum seekers.",

            "Computation theory is a discipline that strives to use mathematical tools and concepts in order to expose the nature of the activity that we call “computation” and to explain a broad range of observed computational phenomena. Why is it harder to perform some computations than others? Are the differences in difficulty that we observe inherent, or are they artifacts of the way we try to perform the computations? Even more basically: how does one reason about such questions? This book strives to endow upper-level undergraduate students and lower-level graduate students with the conceptual and manipulative tools necessary to make Computation theory part of their professional lives. The author tries to achieve this goal via three stratagems that set this book apart from most other texts on the subject. (1) The author develops the necessary mathematical concepts and tools from their simplest instances, so that the student has the opportunity to gain operational control over the necessary mathematics. (2) He organizes the development of the theory around the three “pillars” that give the book its name, so that the student sees computational topics that have the same intellectual origins developed in physical proximity to one another. (3) He strives to illustrate the “big ideas” that computation theory is built upon with applications of these ideas within “practical” domains that the students have seen elsewhere in their courses, in mathematics, in computer science, and in computer engineering.",

            "Many notions and results presented in the previous editions of this volume have since become quite popular in applications, and many of them have been “rediscovered” in applied papers. In the present 3rd edition small changes were made to the chapters in which long-time behavior of the perturbed system is determined by large deviations. Most of these changes concern terminology. In particular, it is explained that the notion of sub-limiting distribution for a given initial point and a time scale is identical to the idea of metastability, that the stochastic resonance is a manifestation of metastability, and that the theory of this effect is a part of the large deviation theory. The reader will also find new comments on the notion of quasi-potential that the authors introduced more than forty years ago, and new references to recent papers in which the proofs of some conjectures included in previous editions have been obtained. Apart from the above mentioned changes the main innovations in the 3rd edition concern the averaging principle. A new Section on deterministic perturbations of one-degree-of-freedom systems was added in Chapter 8. It is shown there that pure deterministic perturbations of an oscillator may lead to a stochastic, in a certain sense, long-time behavior of the system, if the corresponding Hamiltonian has saddle points. The usefulness of a joint consideration of classical theory of deterministic perturbations together with stochastic perturbations is illustrated in this section. Also a new Chapter 9 has been inserted in which deterministic and stochastic perturbations of systems with many degrees of freedom are considered. Because of the resonances, stochastic regularization in this case is even more important.",

The emphasis is on the geometric aspects of the theory and on illustrating how these methods can be used to solve optimal control problems. It provides tools and techniques that go well beyond standard procedures and can be used to obtain a full understanding of the global structure of solutions for the underlying problem. The text includes a large number and variety of fully worked out examples that range from the classical problem of minimum surfaces of revolution to cancer treatment for novel therapy approaches. All these examples, in one way or the other, illustrate the power of geometric techniques and methods. The versatile text contains material on different levels ranging from the introductory and elementary to the advanced. Parts of the text can be viewed as a comprehensive textbook for both advanced undergraduate and all level graduate courses on optimal control in both mathematics and engineering departments. The text moves smoothly from the more introductory topics to those parts that are in a monograph style were advanced topics are presented.

            "Given the manifold challenges of financial sectors in developing and transition countries, one might be tempted to believe that embarking on “green” finance is not a priority for financial systems development. However, there are a number of arguments against this view. Environmental finance, particularly energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) finance, can and should serve as an interface to other sub-sectors of financial sector promotion such as microfinance, housing finance or agricultural finance. For example, existing clients of financial institutions include small and medium-sized enterprises and households, and these are often suffering from high energy prices or have no access to sustainable energy supply. At the same time, these clients are vulnerable to extreme weather events, and often hit hardest by the impact of climate change. There are many other examples which show that the financial sector has an enormous potential to support “green” investments. In order to tap this potential on a sustainable basis, it is important to have a sound understanding which role financial institutions can and should play. Likewise, financial institutions need to understand the demand side of environmental finance markets and the framework conditions in order to be able to design adequate financial products. This book provides a blend of well-founded professional and scientific perspectives on the potential of Environmental finance in developing and transition countries.     All institutions and the clients they serve will be affected by the changing climate. In this new reality, green finance will not be a luxury, but a way of meeting clients' needs effectively and doing sound business. This book challenges, guides, inspires, and, at times, cautions us, in navigating this new normal.

It is concerned with inference based on second order statistics, especially those related to the functional principal component analysis. While it covers inference for independent and identically distributed functional data, its distinguishing feature is an in depth coverage of dependent functional data structures, including functional time series and spatially indexed functions. Specific inferential problems studied include two sample inference, change point analysis, tests for dependence in data and model residuals and functional prediction. All procedures are described algorithmically, illustrated on simulated and real data sets, and supported by a complete asymptotic theory. The book can be read at two levels. Readers interested primarily in methodology will find detailed descriptions of the methods and examples of their application. Researchers interested also in mathematical foundations will find carefully developed theory. The organization of the chapters makes it easy for the reader to choose an appropriate focus. The book introduces the requisite, and frequently used, Hilbert space formalism in a systematic manner.

            "At first sight, finitely generated abelian groups and canonical forms of matrices appear to have little in common. However, reduction to Smith normal form, named after its originator H.J.S.Smith in 1861, is a matrix version of the Euclidean algorithm and is exactly what the theory requires in both cases. Starting with matrices over the integers, Part 1 of this book provides a measured introduction to such groups: two finitely generated abelian groups are isomorphic if and only if their invariant factor sequences are identical. The analogous theory of matrix similarity over a field is then developed in Part 2 starting with matrices having polynomial entries: two matrices over a field are similar if and only if their rational canonical forms are equal. Under certain conditions each matrix is similar to a diagonal or nearly diagonal matrix, namely its Jordan form. The reader is assumed to be familiar with the elementary properties of rings and fields. Also a knowledge of abstract linear algebra including vector spaces, linear mappings, matrices, bases and dimension is essential, although much of the theory is covered in the text but from a more general standpoint: the role of vector spaces is widened to modules over commutative rings. Based on a lecture course taught by the author for nearly thirty years, the book emphasises algorithmic techniques and features numerous worked examples and exercises with solutions. The early chapters form an ideal second course in algebra for second and third year undergraduates. The later chapters, which cover closely related topics, e.g. field extensions, endomorphism rings, automorphism groups, and variants of the canonical forms, will appeal to more advanced students. The book is a bridge between linear and abstract algebra."

            "Annotation, Infrared spectroscopy is a new and innovative technology to study protein folding/misfolding events in the broad arsenal of techniques conventionally used in this field. The progress in understanding protein folding and misfolding is primarily due to the development of biophysical methods which permit to probe conformational changes with high kinetic and structural resolution. The most commonly used approaches rely on rapid mixing methods to initiate the folding event via a sudden change in solvent conditions. Traditionally, techniques such as fluorescence, circular dichroism or visible absorption are applied to probe the process. In contrast to these techniques, infrared spectroscopy came into play only very recently, and the progress made in this field up to date which now permits to probe folding events over the time scale from picoseconds to minutes has not yet been discussed in a book. The aim of this book is to provide an overview of the developments as seen by some of the main contributors to the field. The chapters are not intended to give exhaustive reviews of the literature but, instead to illustrate examples demonstrating the sort of information, which infrared techniques can provide and how this information can be extracted from the experimental data. By discussing the strengths and limitations of the infrared approaches for the investigation of folding and misfolding mechanisms this book helps the reader to evaluate whether a particular system is appropriate for studies by infrared spectroscopy and which specific advantages the techniques offer to solve specific problems",

        "abstract": "A paradigm shift is taking place in computer science: one generation ago, we learned to abstract from hardware to software, now we are abstracting from software to serviceware implemented through service-oriented computing. Yet ensuring interoperability in open, heterogeneous, and dynamically changing environments, such as the Internet, remains a major challenge for actual machine-to-machine integration. Usually significant problems in aligning data, processes, and protocols appear as soon as a specific piece of functionality is used within a different application context.  The Semantic Web Services (SWS) approach is about describing services with metadata on the basis of domain ontologies as a means to enable their automatic location, execution, combination, and use. Fensel and his coauthors provide a comprehensive overview of SWS in line with actual industrial practice. They introduce the main sociotechnological components that ground the SWS vision (like Web Science, Service Science, and service-oriented architectures) and several approaches that realize it, e.g. the Web Service Modeling Framework, OWL-S, and RESTful services. The real-world relevance is emphasized through a series of case studies from large-scale RD projects and a business-oriented proposition from the SWS technology provider Seekda. Each chapter of the book is structured according to a predefined template, covering both theoretical and practical aspects, and including walk-through examples and hands-on exercises.  Additional learning material is available on the book website www.swsbook.org. With its additional features, the book is ideally suited as the basis for courses or self-study in this field, and it may also serve as a reference for researchers looking for a state-of-the-art overview of formalisms, methods, tools, and applications related to SWS.  Dieter Fensel holds a professorship at the University of Innsbruck and is the director of STI Innsbruck, a Computer Science research institute with over 60 employees. He has over 240 publications in the form of scientific books and journals, conferences, and workshop contributions. He has co-organized over 200 conferences and workshops. He has supervised over 40 master and Ph.D. theses and is a recipient of the Carl-Adam-Petri-Award of the Faculty of Economic Sciences from the University of Karlsruhe. His current research interests focus on the development and application of semantics to all areas of Computer Science. Dieter Fensel is also the co-founder and president of the newly established Semantic Technology Institute (STI) International, whose major aim is to establish semantics as a core pillar of modern Computer Science. STI International was the natural progression of DERI International where Dieter Fensel established expedient relationships with major research centers around Europe, Asia and America. Federico Michele Facca was graduated from the Politecnico di Milano, Italy, and is currently a senior researcher at STI Innsbruck where he covers also the position of Institute Manager. His research interests cover Semantic Web Engineering, Semantic Web Services, Adaptive Web Applications, Data Intensive Web Applications and Web Usage Mining. Elena Simperl is currently working as a senior researcher at the STI Innsbruck. Starting from May, 2007, she was appointed to the position of vice director of the institute. Elena holds a PhD in Computer Science from the Free University of Berlin and had held positions as a research assistant at the Technical University of Munich (2002-2003) and the Free University of Berlin (2003-2007) before joining STI Innsbruck early 2007.Elena's primary domain of research is Knowledge Engineering. In particular she is interested in user- and business-oriented aspects of ontology building and management, and in methods and paradigms for facilitating and encouraging knowledge sharing and reuse.",

            "The aim of stochastic programming is to find optimal decisions in problems which involve uncertain data. This field is currently developing rapidly with contributions from many disciplines including operations research, mathematics, and probability. At the same time, it is now being applied in a wide variety of subjects ranging from agriculture to financial planning and from industrial engineering to computer networks. This textbook provides a first course in stochastic programming suitable for students with a basic knowledge of linear programming, elementary analysis, and probability. The authors aim to present a broad overview of the main themes and methods of the subject. Its prime goal is to help students develop an intuition on how to model uncertainty into mathematical problems, what uncertainty changes bring to the decision process, and what techniques help to manage uncertainty in solving the problems. In this extensively updated new edition there is more material on methods and examples including several new approaches for discrete variables, new results on risk measures in modeling and Monte Carlo sampling methods, a new chapter on relationships to other methods including approximate dynamic programming, robust optimization and online methods. The book is highly illustrated with chapter summaries and many examples and exercises. Students, researchers and practitioners in operations research and the optimization area will find it particularly of interest. Review of First Edition: \"The discussion on modeling issues, the large number of examples used to illustrate the material, and the breadth of the coverage make 'Introduction to Stochastic Programming' an ideal textbook for the area.\" (Interfaces, 1998)  ."

        "abstract": "Due to the fast growth of the Web and the difficulties in finding desired information, efficient and effective information retrieval systems have become more important than ever, and the search engine has become an essential tool for many people. The ranker, a central component in every search engine, is responsible for the matching between processed queries and indexed documents. Because of its central role, great attention has been paid to the research and development of ranking technologies. In addition, ranking is also pivotal for many other information retrieval applications, such as collaborative filtering, definition ranking, question answering, multimedia retrieval, text summarization, and online advertisement. Leveraging machine learning technologies in the ranking process has led to innovative and more effective ranking models, and eventually to a completely new research area called learning to rank . Liu first gives a comprehensive review of the major approaches to learning to rank. For each approach he presents the basic framework, with example algorithms, and he discusses its advantages and disadvantages. He continues with some recent advances in learning to rank that cannot be simply categorized into the three major approaches these include relational ranking, query-dependent ranking, transfer ranking, and semisupervised ranking. His presentation is completed by several examples that apply these technologies to solve real information retrieval problems, and by theoretical discussions on guarantees for ranking performance. This book is written for researchers and graduate students in both information retrieval and machine learning. They will find here the only comprehensive description of the state of the art in a field that has driven the recent advances in search engine development.",

            "The premise that giving advice is a design problem is central to this book. It means that advice is seen as an artefact, as information communicated by an advisor to an advisee. Drawing on arguments in philosophy, recent empirical research in individual and group decision-making, and in information systems engineering, the book offers a rigorous approach to the analysis and design of advice in real-world decision situations, in which the advisor must manage with variously imprecise, unclear, incomplete or conflicting qualitative information.",
            "Advice involves recommendations on what to think; through thought, on what to choose; and via choices, on how to act. Advice is information that moves by communication, from advisors to the recipient of advice.Ivan Jureta offers a general way to analyze advice. The analysis applies regardless of what the advice is about and from whom it comes or to whom it needs to be given, and it concentrates on the production and consumption of advice independent of the field of application. It is made up of two intertwined parts, a conceptual analysis and an analysis of the rationale of advice. He premises that giving advice is a design problem and he treats advice as an artifact designed and used to influence decisions.What is unusual is the theoretical backdrop against which the author's discussions are set: ontology engineering, conceptual analysis, and artificial intelligence. While classical decision theory would be expected to play a key role, this is not the case here for one principal reason: the difficulty of having relevant numerical, quantitative estimates of probability and utility in most practical situations. Instead conceptual models and mathematical logic are the author's tools of choice.The book is primarily intended for graduate students and researchers of management science. They are offered a general method of analysis that applies to giving and receiving advice when the decision problems are not well structured, and when there is imprecise, unclear, incomplete, or conflicting qualitative information."

            "This richly illustrated book is an exploration of how chance and risk, on the one hand, and meaning or significance on the other, compete for the limelight in art, in philosophy, and in science. In modern society, prudence and probability calculation permeate our daily lives. Yet it is clear for all to see that neither cautious bank regulations nor mathematics have prevented economic crises from occurring time and again. Nicolas Bouleau argues that it is the meaning we assign to an event that determines the perceived risk, and that we generally turn a blind eye to this important fact, because the word \"meaning\" is itself awkward to explain. He tackles this fundamental question through examples taken from cultural fields ranging from painting, architecture, and music, to poetry, biology, and astronomy. This enables the reader to view overwhelming risks in a different light. Bouleau clarifies that the most important thing in a time of uncertainty is to think of prudence on a higher level, one that truly addresses the various subjective interpretations of the world."

            "Elliptic partial differential equations are important for approaching many problems in mathematical physics, and boundary integral methods play a significant role in their solution. This monograph investigates the latter as they arise in the theory characterizing stationary vibrations of thin elastic plates. The techniques used reduce the complexity of classical three-dimensional elasticity to a system of two independent variables, using eigenfrequencies to model problems with flexural-vibrational elastic body deformation and simplifying these problems to manageable, uniquely solvable integral equations. In under 250 pages, Stationary Oscillations of Elastic Plates develops an impressive amount of theoretical machinery. After introducing the equations describing the vibrations of elastic plates in the first chapter, the book proceeds to explore topics including the single-layer and double-layer plate potentials; the Newtonian potential; the exterior boundary value problems; the direct boundary integral equation method; the Robin boundary value problems; the boundary-contact problem; the null field equations. Throughout, ample time is allotted to laying the groundwork necessary for establishing the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the problems discussed. The book is meant for readers with a knowledge of advanced calculus and some familiarity with functional analysis. It is a useful tool for professionals in pure and applied mathematicians, as well as for theoretical physicists and mechanical engineers with practices involving elastic plates. Graduate students in these fields would also benefit from the monograph as a supplementary text for courses relating to theories of elasticity or flexural vibrations."

            "This volume offers a well-structured overview of existent computational approaches to Riemann surfaces and those currently in development. The authors of the contributions represent the groups providing publically available numerical codes in this field. Thus this volume illustrates which software tools are available and how they can be used in practice. In addition examples for solutions to partial differential equations and in surface theory are presented. The intended audience of this book is twofold. It can be used as a textbook for a graduate course in numerics of Riemann surfaces, in which case the standard undergraduate background, i.e., calculus and linear algebra, is required. In particular, no knowledge of the theory of Riemann surfaces is expected; the necessary background in this theory is contained in the Introduction chapter. At the same time, this book is also intended for specialists in geometry and mathematical physics applying the theory of Riemann surfaces in their research. It is the first book on numerics of Riemann surfaces that reflects the progress made in this field during the last decade, and it contains original results. There are a growing number of applications that involve the evaluation of concrete characteristics of models analytically described in terms of Riemann surfaces. Many problem settings and computations in this volume are motivated by such concrete applications in geometry and mathematical physics"

            "The quantum groups discussed in this book are the quantized enveloping algebras introduced by Drinfeld and Jimbo in 1985, or variations thereof. It is shown that these algebras have natural integral forms that can be specialized at roots of 1 and yield new objects, which include quantum versions of the semi-simple groups over fields of positive characteristic. The theory of quantum groups has led to a new, extremely rigid structure, in which the objects of the theory are provided with canonical bases having rather remarkable properties. This book contains an extensive treatment of the theory of canonical bases in the framework of perverse sheaves. The theory developed in the book includes the case of quantum affine enveloping algebras and, more generally, the quantum analogs of the Kac–Moody Lie algebras. Introduction to Quantum Groups will be of interest to mathematicians working in the representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, knot theorists, theoretical physicists, and graduate students. Since large parts of the book are independent of the theory of perverse sheaves, the work may also be used as a textbook. **************************************** There is no doubt that this volume is a very remarkable piece of work...Its appearance represents a landmark in the mathematical literature. —Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society This book is an important contribution to the field and can be recommended especially to mathematicians working in the field. —EMS Newsletter The present book gives a very efficient presentation of an important part of quantum group theory. It is a valuable contribution to the literature. —Mededelingen van het Wiskundig Lusztig's book is very well written and seems to be flawless...Obviously, this will be the standard reference book for the material presented and anyone interested in the Drinfeld–Jimbo algebras will have to study it very carefully. —ZAA [T]his book is much more than an 'introduction to quantum groups.'

Although in the past most of the great discoveries have been made by professional radio astronomers using large radio telescopes built for institutions, today even amateurs can build and use small radio telescopes and make discoveries that can contribute to the general store of knowledge. And you don’t need to be an electronics genius or rich! Jeff Lashley, in this comprehensive guide to the science and art of putting together and using a small radio telescope, will lead you through the process and help you to understand what to listen for. Filled with projects and tips and great advice, he can get you underway in a hurry and help you to decode what you are hearing. So if you’ve been doing amateur astronomy for a while and want to expand beyond what you can see with your eyes, this is a direction you should consider going in. Or, if you’ve dabbled in building radios for years and want to try something new, this can be a way to expand your hobby. Either way, start now listening to the fireworks going on all around you-you’ll be amazed!"

            "This proposed text appears to be a good introduction to evolutionary computation for use in applied statistics research. The authors draw from a vast base of knowledge about the current literature in both the design of evolutionary algorithms and statistical techniques. Modern statistical research is on the threshold of solving increasingly complex problems in high dimensions, and the generalization of its methodology to parameters whose estimators do not follow mathematically simple distributions is underway. Many of these challenges involve optimizing functions for which analytic solutions are infeasible. Evolutionary algorithms represent a powerful and easily understood means of approximating the optimum value in a variety of settings. The proposed text seeks to guide readers through the crucial issues of optimization problems in statistical settings and the implementation of tailored methods (including both stand-alone evolutionary algorithms and hybrid crosses of these procedures with standard statistical algorithms like Metropolis-Hastings) in a variety of applications. This book would serve as an excellent reference work for statistical researchers at an advanced graduate level or beyond, particularly those with a strong background in computer science.",

        "abstract": "This book is a first sketch of what the overall field of performance could look like as a modern scientific field but not its stylistically differentiated practice, pedagogy, and history. Musical performance is the most complex field of music. It comprises the study of a composition',s expression in terms of analysis, emotion, and gesture, and then its transformation into embodied reality, turning formulaic facts into dramatic movements of human cognition. Combining these components in a creative way is a sophisticated mix of knowledge and mastery, which more resembles the cooking of a delicate recipe than a rational procedure.  This book is the first one aiming at such comprehensive coverage of the topic, and it does so also as a university text book. We include musicological and philosophical aspects as well as empirical performance research. Presenting analytical tools and case studies turns this project into a demanding enterprise in construction and experimental setups of performances, especially those generated by the music software Rubato.  We are happy that this book was written following a course for performance students at the School of Music of the University of Minnesota. Their education should not be restricted to the canonical practice. They must know the rationale for their performance. It is not sufficient to learn performance with the old-fashioned imitation model of the teacher's antetype, this cannot be an exclusive tool since it dramatically lacks the poetical precision asked for by Adorno's and Benjamin's micrologic. Without such alternatives to intuitive imitation, performance risks being disconnected from the audience.",

            "This is an introductory-level text on stochastic modeling. It is suited for undergraduate students in engineering, operations research, statistics, mathematics, actuarial science, business management, computer science, and public policy. It employs a large number of examples to teach the students to use stochastic models of real-life systems to predict their performance, and use this analysis to design better systems. The book is devoted to the study of important classes of stochastic processes: discrete and continuous time Markov processes, Poisson processes, renewal and regenerative processes, semi-Markov processes, queueing models, and diffusion processes. The book systematically studies the short-term and the long-term behavior, cost/reward models, and first passage times. All the material is illustrated with many examples, and case studies. The book provides a concise review of probability in the appendix. The book emphasizes numerical answers to the problems. A collection of MATLAB programs to accompany the this book can be downloaded from http://www.unc.edu/~vkulkarn/Maxim/maxim.zip. A graphical user interface to access the above files can be downloaded from http://www.unc.edu/~vkulkarn/Maxim/maximgui.zip . The second edition incorporates several changes. First its title reflects the changes in content: the chapters on design and control have been removed. The book now contains several case studies that teach the design principles. Two new chapters have been added. The new chapter on Poisson processes gives more attention to this important class of stochastic processes than the first edition did. The new chapter on Brownian motion reflects its increasing importance as an appropriate model for a variety of real-life situations, including finance. V. G. Kulkarni is Professor in the Department of Statistics and Operations Research in the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He has authored a graduate-level text Modeling and Analysis of Stochastic Systems and dozens of articles on stochastic models of queues, computer and communications systems, and production and supply chain systems.

For diffusions, the killing is at the boundary and for dynamical systems there is a trap. The authors present the QSDs as the ones that allow describing the long-term behavior conditioned to not being killed. Studies in this research area started with Kolmogorov and Yaglom and in the last few decades have received a great deal of attention. The authors provide the exponential distribution property of the killing time for QSDs, present the more general result on their existence and study the process of trajectories that survive forever. For birth-and-death chains and diffusions, the existence of a single or a continuum of QSDs is described. They study the convergence to the extremal QSD and give the classification of the survival process. In this monograph, the authors discuss Gibbs QSDs for symbolic systems and absolutely continuous QSDs for repellers. The findings described are relevant to researchers in the fields of Markov chains, diffusions, potential theory, dynamical systems, and in areas where extinction is a central concept. The theory is illustrated with numerous examples. The volume uniquely presents the distribution behavior of individuals who survive in a decaying population for a very long time.

            "This book presents recent advances (from 2008 to 2012) concerning use of the Naïve Bayes model in unsupervised word sense disambiguation (WSD). While WSD, in general, has a number of important applications in various fields of artificial intelligence (information retrieval, text processing, machine translation, message understanding, man-machine communication etc.), unsupervised WSD is considered important because it is language-independent and does not require previously annotated corpora. The Naïve Bayes model has been widely used in supervised WSD, but its use in unsupervised WSD has led to more modest disambiguation results and has been less frequent. It seems that the potential of this statistical model with respect to unsupervised WSD continues to remain insufficiently explored. The present book contends that the Naïve Bayes model needs to be fed knowledge in order to perform well as a clustering technique for unsupervised WSD and examines three entirely different sources of such knowledge for feature selection: WordNet, dependency relations and web N-grams. WSD with an underlying Naïve Bayes model is ultimately positioned on the border between unsupervised and knowledge-based techniques. The benefits of feeding knowledge (of various natures) to a knowledge-lean algorithm for unsupervised WSD that uses the Naïve Bayes model as clustering technique are clearly highlighted. The discussion shows that the Naïve Bayes model still holds promise for the open problem of unsupervised WSD.",

This point of view is generalized to holonomic systems of linear differential equations in the complex domain, and a general Riemann-Hilbert correspondence is proved for vector bundles with meromorphic connections on a complex manifold. Applications to the distributions solutions to such systems are also discussed, and various operations on Stokes-filtered local systems are analyzed",

            "Problems in Probability comprises one of the most comprehensive, nearly encyclopedic, collections of problems and exercises in probability theory. Albert Shiryaev has skillfully created, collected, and compiled the exercises in this text over the course of many years while working on topics which interested him the most. A substantial number of the exercises resulted from diverse sources such as textbooks, lecture notes, exercise manuals, monographs, and discussions that took place during special seminars for graduate and undergraduate students. Many problems contain helpful hints and other relevant comments and a portion of the material covers some important applications from optimal control and mathematical finance. Readers of diverse backgrounds—from students to researchers—will find a great deal of value in this book and can treat the work as an exercise manual, a handbook, or as a supplementary text to a course in probability theory, control, and mathematical finance. The problems and exercises in this book vary in nature and degree of difficulty. Some problems are meant to test the reader’s basic understanding, others are of medium-to-high degrees of difficulty and require more creative thinking. Other problems are meant to develop additional theoretical concepts and tools or to familiarize the reader with various facts that are not necessarily covered in mainstream texts.

They played for example a vital role in Andrew Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. This text provides a concise introduction to the world of automorphic forms using two approaches: the classic elementary theory and the modern point of view of adeles and representation theory. The reader will learn the important aims and results of the theory by focussing on its essential aspects and restricting it to the 'base field' of rational numbers. Students interested for example in arithmetic geometry or number theory will find that this book provides an optimal and easily accessible introduction into this topic.",

            "Six Sigma has arisen in the last two decades as a breakthrough Quality Management Methodology. With Six Sigma, we are solving problems and improving processes using as a basis one of the most powerful tools of human development: the scientific method. For the analysis of data, Six Sigma requires the use of statistical software, being R an Open Source option that fulfills this requirement. R is a software system that includes a programming language widely used in academic and research departments. Nowadays, it is becoming a real alternative within corporate environments.  The aim of this book is to show how R can be used as the software tool in the development of Six Sigma projects. The book includes a gentle introduction to Six Sigma and a variety of examples showing how to use R within real situations. It has been conceived as a self contained piece. Therefore, it is addressed not only to Six Sigma practitioners, but also to professionals trying to initiate themselves in this management methodology. The book may be used as a text book as well."

            "This is the first volume of three books by the same author, devoted entirely to classical mechanics. The triad of works covers different subjects in classical mechanics and creates a link between them by deriving topics from the same root. Moreover, the author unifies different approaches from English, Russian, Polish, and German literature devoted to classical mechanics. Emphasis is placed on the study of electro-magneto-mechanical systems. Classical Mechanics: Kinematics and Statics is addressed to a wide spectrum of undergraduate and graduate students, postgraduate students, researchers, and instructors, from the fields of mechanical and civil engineering. This volume, which includes a wealth of worked examples and applications, is also intended to be used as a self-contained reference for researchers in applied mathematics and physical sciences. It is also recommended as a supplementary textbook at the upper undergraduate and graduate levels. In Chapter 1 the fundamental principles of mechanics are formulated, illustrated, and discussed. Chapter 2 is devoted to statics and Chapter 3 presents the geometry of masses. Kinematics of a particle, the curvilinear and normal coordinates, and kinematic pairs and chains are the main focus of Chapter 4. Chapter 5 studies the kinematics of a rigid body and a composite motion of a particle. Chapter 6 ends the text with kinematics of a deformable body.",

            "This set of five volumes, four volumes edited by Edward D. Palik and a volume by Gorachand Ghosh, is a unique resource for any science and technology library. It provides materials researchers and optical device designers with reference facts in a context not available anywhere else. The singular functionality of the set derives from the unique format for the three core volumes that comprise the Handbook of Optical Constants of Solids. The Handbook satisfies several essential needs: first, it affords the most comprehensive database of the refractive index and extinction (or loss) coefficient of technically important and scientifically interesting dielectrics. This data has been critically selected and evaluated by authorities on each material. Second, the dielectric constant database is supplemented by tutorial chapters covering the basics of dielectric theory and reviews of experimental techniques for each wavelength region and material characteristic. As an additional resource, two of the tutorial chapters summarize the relevant characteristics of each of the materials in the database. The data in the core volumes have been collected and analyzed over a period of twelve years, with the most recent completed in 1997. The volumes systematically define the dielectric properties of 143 of the most engaging materials, including metals, semiconductors, and insulators. Together, the three Palik books contain nearly 3,000 pages, with about 2/3 devoted to the dielectric constant data. The tutorial chapters in the remaining 1/3 of the pages contain a wealth of information, including some dielectric data. Hence, the separate volume, Index to Handbook of Optical Constants of Solids, which is included as part of the set, substantially enhances the utility of the Handbook and in essence, joins all the Palik volumes into one unit. It isthen of great importance to users of the set. A final volume rounds out the set. The Handbook of Thermo-Optic Coefficients of Optical Materials with Applications collects refractive index measurements and their temperature dependence for a large number of crystals and glasses. Mathematical models represent these data, and in turn are used in the design of nonlinear optical devices. * Unique source of extremely useful optical data for a very broad community of scientists, researchers, and practitioners * Will be of great practical applicability to both industry and research * Presents optical constants for a broadest spectral range, for a very large number of materials: Paliks three volumes include 143 materials including 43 elements; Ghoshs volume includes some 70 technologically interesting crystals and many commercial glasses * Includes a special index volume that enables the user to search for the information in the three Palik volumes easily and quickly * Critique chapters in the Palik volumes discuss the data and give reference to most of the literature available for each material * Presents various techniques for measuring the optical constants and mathematical models for analytical calculations of some data",

            "In the last 40 years, machine vision has evolved into a mature field embracing a wide range of applications including surveillance, automated inspection, robot assembly, vehicle guidance, traffic monitoring and control, signature verification, biometric measurement, and analysis of remotely sensed images. While researchers and industry specialists continue to document their work in this area, it has become increasingly difficult for professionals and graduate students to understand the essential theory and practicalities well enough to design their own algorithms and systems. This book directly addresses this need. As in earlier editions, E.R. Davies clearly and systematically presents the basic concepts of the field in highly accessible prose and images, covering essential elements of the theory while emphasizing algorithmic and practical design constraints. In this thoroughly updated edition, he divides the material into horizontal levels of a complete machine vision system. Application case studies demonstrate specific techniques and illustrate key constraints for designing real-world machine vision systems. Includes solid, accessible coverage of 2-D and 3-D scene analysis. Offers thorough treatment of the Hough Transforma key technique for inspection and surveillance.

            "Linear systems with constraints on inputs and states are ubiquitous. Control of such systems has been a long-time challenge to control engineers and will continue to remain so. Indeed, the challenge of constraints is intense and dauntingly formidable and familiar. This book focuses on the very fundamental and primary goal of providing internal stability as well as external stability in the presence of disturbances and reference inputs. The focus is on both the analysis and design for both continuous- and discrete-time systems. A taxonomy of constraints paves distinct paths showing what is feasible and what is not. Internal and External Stabilization of Linear Systems with Constraints is an excellent reference for practicing engineers, graduate students, and researchers in control systems theory and design. The book may also serve as an advanced graduate text for a course or a seminar in nonlinear control systems theory and design in applied mathematics or engineering departments. Minimal prerequisites include a first graduate course in state-space methods as well as a first course in control systems design.",

            "Missing data have long plagued those conducting applied research in the social, behavioral, and health sciences. Good missing data analysis solutions are available, but practical information about implementation of these solutions has been lacking. The objective of Missing Data: Analysis and Design is to enable investigators who are non-statisticians to implement modern missing data procedures properly in their research, and reap the benefits in terms of improved accuracy and statistical power. Missing Data: Analysis and Design contains essential information for both beginners and advanced readers. For researchers with limited missing data analysis experience, this book offers an easy-to-read introduction to the theoretical underpinnings of analysis of missing data; provides clear, step-by-step instructions for performing state-of-the-art multiple imputation analyses; and offers practical advice, based on over 20 years' experience, for avoiding and troubleshooting problems. For more advanced readers, unique discussions of attrition, non-Monte-Carlo techniques for simulations involving missing data, evaluation of the benefits of auxiliary variables, and highly cost-effective planned missing data designs are provided. The author lays out missing data theory in a plain English style that is accessible and precise. Most analyses described in the book are conducted using the well-known statistical software packages SAS and SPSS, supplemented by Norm 2.03 and associated Java-based automation utilities. A related web site contains free downloads of the supplementary software, as well as sample empirical data sets and a variety of practical exercises described in the book to enhance and reinforce the reader’s learning experience. Missing Data: Analysis and Design and its web site work together to enable beginners to gain confidence in their ability to conduct missing data analysis, and more advanced readers to expand their skill set. JOHN W. GRAHAM, PhD, is Professor of Biobehavioral Health at The Pennsylvania State University. His research and publishing focus on the evaluation of health promotion and disease prevention interventions. He specializes in evaluation research methods, including missing data analysis and design, structural equation modeling, and measurement.",

This thesis presents an experimental and theoretical study of the coherent properties of trapped atomic ensembles at high densities, which are essential to many of the aforementioned applications. The study focuses on how inter-particle interactions modify the ensemble coherence dynamics, and whether it is possible to extend the coherence time by means of external control. The thesis presents a theoretical model which explains the effect of elastic collision of the coherence dynamics and then reports on experiments which test this model successfully in the lab.

The ability to manipulate and control electron and/or nucleus spin in semiconductor devices provides a new route to expand the capabilities of inorganic semiconductor-based electronics and to design innovative devices with potential application in quantum computing. One of the major challenges towards these objectives is to develop semiconductor-based systems and architectures in which the spatial distribution of spins and their properties can be controlled. For instance, to eliminate electron spin decoherence resulting from hyperfine interaction due to nuclear spin background, isotopically controlled devices are needed (i.e., nuclear spin-depleted). In other emerging concepts, the control of the spatial distribution of isotopes with nuclear spins is a prerequisite to implement the quantum bits (or qbits). Therefore, stable semiconductor isotopes are important elements in the development of solid-state quantum information.

In recent years, scientists have made great progress in understanding how such complex systems operate, ranging from animal populations to earthquakes and weather. These systems show behaviours that cannot be predicted or intuited by focusing on the individual components, but which emerge spontaneously as a consequence of their interactions: they are said to be self-organized.

        "abstract": "Brownian dynamics serve as mathematical models for the diffusive motion of microscopic particles of various shapes in gaseous, liquid, or solid environments. The renewed interest in Brownian dynamics is due primarily to their key role in molecular and cellular biophysics: diffusion of ions and molecules is the driver of all life. Brownian dynamics simulations are the numerical realizations of stochastic differential equations that model the functions of biological micro devices such as protein ionic channels of biological membranes, cardiac myocytes, neuronal synapses, and many more. Stochastic differential equations are ubiquitous models in computational physics, chemistry, biophysics, computer science, communications theory, mathematical finance theory, and many other disciplines. Brownian dynamics simulations of the random motion of particles, be it molecules or stock prices, give rise to mathematical problems that neither the kinetic theory of Maxwell and Boltzmann, nor Einstein’s and Langevin’s theories of Brownian motion could predict. This book takes the readers on a journey that starts with the rigorous definition of mathematical Brownian motion, and ends with the explicit solution of a series of complex problems that have immediate applications. It is aimed at applied mathematicians, physicists, theoretical chemists, and physiologists who are interested in modeling, analysis, and simulation of micro devices of microbiology. The book contains exercises and worked out examples throughout",

The articles address the increasing gap between what should be possible in Computational Science and Engineering due to recent advances in algorithms, hardware, and networks, and what can actually be achieved in practice; they also examine novel computing architectures, where computation itself is a multifaceted process, with hardware awareness or ubiquitous parallelism due to many-core systems being just two of the challenges faced. Topics cover both the methodological aspects of advanced computing (algorithms, parallel computing, data exploration, software engineering) and cutting-edge applications from the fields of chemistry, the geosciences, civil and mechanical engineering, etc., reflecting the highly interdisciplinary nature of the Munich Centre of Advanced Computing."

The chapters, written by top experts, include computer tutorials that emphasize the computational aspects of the respective areas. Monomial ideals and algebras are, in a sense, among the simplest structures in commutative algebra and the main objects of combinatorial commutative algebra. Also, they are of major importance for at least three reasons. Firstly, Gröbner basis theory allows us to treat certain problems on general polynomial ideals by means of monomial ideals. Secondly, the combinatorial structure of monomial ideals connects them to other combinatorial structures and allows us to solve problems on both sides of this correspondence using the techniques of each of the respective areas. And thirdly, the combinatorial nature of monomial ideals also makes them particularly well suited to the development of algorithms to work with them and then generate algorithms for more general structures.",

Three further completions are treated in the second part. The first applications of the quasiseparable and semiseparable structure are included in the third part, where the interplay between the quasiseparable structure and discrete time varying linear systems with boundary conditions play an essential role. The fourth part includes factorization and inversion fast algorithms for matrices via quasiseparable and semiseparable structures.

They are applied to optical and electrical devices that support the information communication technology in the mid 21-th century. Accordingly, it is quite important to have a broad knowledge of the optical properties of advanced materials for students, scientists and engineers working in optics and related fields. This book is designed to teach fundamental optical properties of such advanced materials effectively. These materials have their own peculiarities which are very interesting in modern optical physics and also for applications because the concepts of optical properties are quite different from those in conventional optical materials. Hence each chapter starts to review the basic concepts of the materials briefly and proceeds to the practical use. The important topics covered in this book include:  quantum structures of semiconductors, spintronics,  photonic crystals, surface plasmons in metallic nanostructures, photonic metamaterials, liquid crystal materials, organic LED materials and magnet-optics.",

        "abstract": "The focus of this monograph is the study of rings and modules which have a rich supply of direct summands with respect to various extensions. The first four chapters of the book discuss rings and modules which generalize injectivity (e.g., extending modules), or for which certain annihilators become direct summands (e.g., Baer rings). Ring extensions such as matrix, polynomial, group ring, and essential extensions of rings from the aforementioned classes are considered in the next three chapters. A theory of ring and module hulls relative to a specific class of rings or modules is introduced and developed in the following two chapters. While applications of the results presented can be found throughout the book, the final chapter mainly consists of applications to algebra and functional analysis. These include obtaining characterizations of rings of quotients as direct products of prime rings and descriptions of certain C*-algebras via (quasi-)Baer rings. Extensions of Rings and Modules introduces for the first time in book form: * Baer, quasi-Baer, and Rickart modules   * The theory of generalized triangular matrix rings via sets of triangulating idempotents * A discussion of essential overrings that are not rings of quotients of a base ring and Osofsky's study on the self-injectivity of the injective hull of a ring * Applications of the theory of quasi-Baer rings to C*-algebras Each section of the book is enriched with examples and exercises which make this monograph useful not only for experts but also as a text for advanced graduate courses. Historical notes appear at the end of each chapter, and a list of Open Problems and Questions is provided to stimulate further research in this area. With over 400 references, Extensions of Rings and Modules will be of interest to researchers in algebra and analysis and to advanced graduate students in mathematics",

Many illustrated examples and code chunks guide the reader into their modeling and interpretation. And, though the book primarily serves as a reference guide for the R package “compositions,” it is also a general introductory text on Compositional Data Analysis. Awareness of their special characteristics spread in the Geosciences in the early sixties, but a strategy for properly dealing with them was not available until the works of Aitchison in the eighties. Since then, research has expanded our understanding of their theoretical principles and the potentials and limitations of their interpretation. This is the first comprehensive textbook addressing these issues, as well as their practical implications with regard to software. The book is intended for scientists interested in statistically analyzing their compositional data. The subject enjoys relatively broad awareness in the geosciences and environmental sciences, but the spectrum of recent applications also covers areas like medicine, official statistics, and economics. Readers should be familiar with basic univariate and multivariate statistics. Knowledge of R is recommended but not required, as the book is self-contained."

        "abstract": "In recent years, the fabrication of nanomaterials and exploration of their properties have attracted the attention of various scientific disciplines such as biology, physics, chemistry, and engineering. Although nanoparticulate systems are of significant interest in various scientific and technological areas, there is little known about the safety of these nanoscale objects. It has now been established that the surfaces of nanoparticles are immediately covered by biomolecules (e.g. proteins, ions, and enzymes) upon their entrance into a biological medium. This interaction with the biological medium modulates the surface of the nanoparticles, conferring a “biological identity” to their surfaces (referred to as a “corona”), which determines the subsequent cellular/tissue responses. The new interface between the nanoparticles and the biological medium/proteins, called “bio-nano interface,” has been very rarely studied in detail to date, though the interest in this topic is rapidly growing. In this book, the importance of the physiochemical characteristics of nanoparticles for the properties of the protein corona is discussed in detail, followed by comprehensive descriptions of the methods for assessing the protein-nanoparticle interactions. The advantages and limitations of available corona evaluation methods (e.g. spectroscopy methods, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, and differential centrifugal sedimentation) are examined in detail, followed by a discussion of the possibilities for enhancing the current methods and a call for new techniques. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of protein-nanoparticle interaction phenomena are explored and discussed, with a focus on the biological impacts",

In particular, this book investigates entanglement properties of flying electronic qubits generated in some of the well known processes capable of taking place in an atom or a molecule following the absorption of a photon. Here, one can generate Coulombic or fine-structure entanglement of electronic qubits. The properties of these entanglements differ not only from each other, but also from those when spin of an inner-shell photoelectron is entangled with the polarization of the subsequent fluorescence.

            "There has been an enormous infusion of new ideas in the field of solar cells over the last 15 years; discourse on energy transfer has gotten much richer, and nanostructures and nanomaterials have revolutionized the possibilities for new technological developments. However, solar energy cannot become ubiquitous in the world's power markets unless it can become economically competitive with legacy generation methods such as fossil fuels. The new edition of Dr. Stephen Fonash's definitive text points the way toward greater efficiency and cheaper production by adding coverage of cutting-edge topics in plasmonics, multi-exiton generation processes, nanostructures and nanomaterials such as quantum dots. The book's new structure improves readability by shifting many detailed equations to appendices, and balances the first edition's semiconductor coverage with an emphasis on thin-films. Further, it now demonstrates physical principles with simulations in the well-known AMPS computer code developed by the author. *Classic text now updated with new advances in nanomaterials and thin films that point the way to cheaper, more efficient solar energy production *Many of the detailed equations from the first edition have been shifted to appendices in order to improve readability *Important theoretical points are now accompanied by concrete demonstrations via included simulations created with the well-known AMPS computer code"

        "abstract": "How did life originate on Earth? For over 50 years, scientists believed that life was the result of a chemical reaction involving simple molecules such as methane and ammonia cooking in a primordial soup. Recent space observations have revealed that old stars are capable of making very complex organic compounds. At some point in their evolution, stars eject those organics and spread them all over the Milky Way galaxy. There is evidence that these organic dust particles actually reached the early Solar System. Through bombardments by comets and asteroids, the young Earth inherited significant amounts of stardust. Was the development of life assisted by the arrival of these extraterrestrial materials?  In this book, the author describes stunning discoveries in astronomy and solar system science made over the last 10 years that have yielded a new perspective on the origin of life. Other interesting topics discussed in this book The discovery of diamonds and other gemstones in space The origin of oil Neon signs and fluorescent lights in space Smoke from the stars Stardust in our hands Where oceans come from The possibility of bacteria in spaceAbout the author Sun Kwok is a leading world authority on the subject of astrochemistry and stellar evolution. He is best known for his theory on the origin of planetary nebulae and the death of Sun-like stars. His most recent research has been on the synthesis of complex organic compounds in the late stages of stellar evolution. He is the author of a number of books, including Cosmic Butterflies: The Colorful Mysteries of Planetary Nebulae",

        "abstract": "This book summarizes the experimental evidence and modern classical and theoretical approaches in understanding the vitreous state, from structural problems, over equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics, to statistical physics. Glasses, and especially silicate glasses, are only the best known representatives of this particular physical state of matter. Other typical representatives include organic polymer glasses, and many other easily vitrifying organic and inorganic substances, technically important materials, amidst them vitreous water and vitrified aqueous solutions, and also many metallic alloy systems. Some of these systems only form glasses under particular conditions, e.g. through ultra-rapid cooling. This book describes the properties and the formation of both every-day technical glasses and especially of such more exotic forms of vitreous matter.It is a unique source of knowledge and new ideas for materials scientists, engineers and researchers working on condensed matter. The new edition emphasizes latest experimental findings and modern theories, explaining the kinetics of glass formation, the relaxation and stabilization of glasses and their crystallization in terms of new models, derived from the framework of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes. It shows how the properties of common technical glasses, window glass, or the vitreous ice kernel of comets can be used to develop a new understanding of the existence of matter in various, unusual forms. The developed theoretical models can find application even in the description of lasers and in unusual processes in the universe",

        "abstract": "This book addresses an interesting area of quantum computation called quantum walks, which play an important role in building quantum algorithms, in particular search algorithms. Quantum walks are the quantum analogue of classical random walks.It is known that quantum computers have great power for searching unsorted databases. This power extends to many kinds of searches, particularly to the problem of finding a specific location in a spatial layout, which can be modeled by a graph. The goal is to find a specific node knowing that the particle uses the edges to jump from one node to the next.This book is self-contained with main topics that include:Grover's algorithm, describing its geometrical interpretation and evolution by means of the spectral decomposition of the evolution operaterAnalytical solutions of quantum walks on important graphs like line, cycles, two-dimensional lattices, and hypercubes using Fourier transformsQuantum walks on generic graphs, describing methods to calculate the limiting distribution and mixing timeSpatial search algorithms, with emphasis on the abstract search algorithm (the two-dimensional lattice is used as an example)Szedgedy's quantum-walk model and a natural definition of quantum hitting time (the complete graph is used as an example)The reader will benefit from the pedagogical aspects of the book, learning faster and with more ease than would be possible from the primary research literature. Exercises and references further deepen the reader's understanding, and guidelines for the use of computer programs to simulate the evolution of quantum walks are also provided",

The author, a leading authority on the subject, sets out numerous results previously unpublished in book form. In addition to outlining the properties and structures of positive linear maps of operator algebras into the bounded operators on a Hilbert space, he guides readers through proofs of the Stinespring theorem and its applications to inequalities for positive maps. The text examines the maps’ positivity properties, as well as their associated linear functionals together with their density operators. It features special sections on extremal positive maps and Choi matrices. In sum, this is a vital publication that covers a full spectrum of matters relating to positive linear maps, of which a large proportion is relevant and applicable to today’s quantum information theory. The latter sections of the book present the material in finite dimensions, while the text as a whole appeals to a wider and more general readership by keeping the mathematics as elementary as possible throughout. ."

These theories are important, not just because they apply to practical problems of industrial interest, but because they form a solid theoretical base upon which mathematical techniques can be built, from which more complex theories can be constructed, to better mimic material behaviour. The emphasis is not on the voluminous current topical research, but on the necessary tools to understand viscoelasticity at a first year graduate level. The main aim is to provide a still compact book, sufficient at the level of first year graduate course for those who wish to understand viscoelasticity and to embark in modeling of viscoelastic multiphase fluids. To this end, a new chapter on Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) was introduced which is relevant to model complex-structured fluids.

            "This book presents an integrated methodology for sequential experimentation in clinical trials. The methodology allows sequential learning during the course of a trial to improve the efficiency of the trial design, which often lacks adequate information at the planning stage. Adaptation via sequential learning of unknown parameters is a central idea not only in adaptive designs of confirmatory clinical trials but also in the theory of optimal nonlinear experimental design, which the book covers as introductory material. Other introductory topics for which the book provides preparatory background include sequential testing theory, dynamic programming and stochastic optimization, survival analysis and resampling methods. In this way, the book gives a self-contained and thorough treatment of group sequential and adaptive designs, time-sequential trials with failure-time endpoints, and statistical inference at the conclusion of these trials. The book can be used for graduate courses in sequential analysis, clinical trials, and biostatistics, and also for short courses on clinical trials at professional meetings. Each chapter ends with supplements for the reader to explore related concepts and methods, and problems which can be used for exercises in graduate courses. Jay Bartroff is Associate Professor of Mathematics at the University of Southern California where he is a member of the Laboratory of Applied Pharmacokinetics at the USC Keck School of Medicine.

            "Many phenomena in engineering and mathematical physics can be modeled by means of boundary value problems for a certain elliptic differential operator in a given domain. When the differential operator under discussion is of second order a variety of tools are available for dealing with such problems, including boundary integral methods, variational methods, harmonic measure techniques, and methods based on classical harmonic analysis. When the differential operator is of higher-order (as is the case, e.g., with anisotropic plate bending when one deals with a fourth order operator) only a few options could be successfully implemented. In the 1970s Alberto Calderón, one of the founders of the modern theory of Singular Integral Operators, advocated the use of layer potentials for the treatment of higher-order elliptic boundary value problems. The present monograph represents the first systematic treatment based on this approach. This research monograph lays, for the first time, the mathematical foundation aimed at solving boundary value problems for higher-order elliptic operators in non-smooth domains using the layer potential method and addresses a comprehensive range of topics, dealing with elliptic boundary value problems in non-smooth domains including layer potentials, jump relations, non-tangential maximal function estimates, multi-traces and extensions, boundary value problems with data in Whitney-Lebesque spaces, Whitney-Besov spaces, Whitney-Sobolev- based Lebesgue spaces, Whitney-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces,Whitney-Sobolev-based Hardy spaces, Whitney-BMO and Whitney-VMO spaces"

Understanding them in depth is essential both for pure research and for their applications. This book provides a clear, thorough presentation of their symmetry, both at the microscopic space-group level and the macroscopic point-group level. The implications of the symmetry of crystals for their physical properties are then presented, together with their mathematical description in terms of tensors. The conditions on the symmetry of a crystal for a given property to exist then become clear, as does the symmetry of the property. The geometrical representation of tensor quantities or properties is presented, and its use in determining important relationships emphasized. An original feature of this book is that most chapters include exercises with complete solutions. This allows readers to test and improve their understanding of the material. The intended readership includes undergraduate and graduate students in materials science and materials-related aspects of electrical and optical engineering; researchers involved in the investigation of the physical properties of crystals and the design of applications based on crystal properties such as piezoelectricity, electro-optics, optical activity and all those involved in the characterization of the structural properties of materials",

            "Vladimir Maz'ya (born 1937) is an outstanding mathematician who systematically made fundamental contributions to a wide array of areas in mathematical analysis and in the theory of partial differential equations. In this fascinating book he describes the first thirty years of his life in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). He starts with the story of his family, speaks about his childhood, the high school and university years, and recalls his formative years as a mathematician. Behind the author's personal recollections, with his own joys, sorrows and hopes, one sees a vivid picture of those times in the former Sovjet Union. He speaks warmly about his friends, both outside and inside the world of mathematics, about discovering his passion for mathematics and his early achievements, and about a number of mathematicians who influenced his professional life. The book is written in a highly readable and inviting style, spiced with the occasional touch of humor",

The theory of such systems is motivated by the long-term goal to establish rigorous mathematical models for turbulent and chaotic phenomena. The aim here is to offer general methods and abstract results pertaining to fundamental dynamical systems properties related to dissipative long-time behavior. The book systematically presents, develops and uses the quasi-stability method while substantially extending it by including for consideration new classes of models and PDE systems arising in Continuum Mechanics. The book can be used as a textbook in dissipative dynamics at the graduate level. Igor Chueshov is a Professor of Mathematics at Karazin Kharkov National University in Kharkov, Ukraine",

            "The highly successful Hubble Space Telescope was meant to change our view and understanding of the universe. Within weeks of its launch in 1990, however, the space community was shocked to find out that the primary mirror of the telescope was flawed. It was only the skills of scientists and engineers on the ground and the daring talents of astronauts sent to service the telescope in December 1993 that saved the mission. For over two decades NASA had developed the capabilities to service a payload in orbit. This involved numerous studies and the creation of a ground-based infrastructure to support the challenging missions. Unique tools and EVA hardware supported the skills developed in crew training that then enabled astronauts to complete a demanding series of spacewalks. Drawing upon first hand interviews with those closely involved in the project over thirty years ago this story explains the development of the servicing mission concept and the hurdles that had to be overcome to not only launch the telescope but also to mount the first servicing mission – a mission that restored the telescope to full working order three years after its launch, saved the reputation of NASA, and truly opened a new age in understanding of our place in space. This is not just a tale of space age technology, astronauts and astronomy. It is also a story of an audacious scientific vision, and the human ingenuity and determination to overcome all obstacles to make it possible. Hubble Space Telescope: From Concept to Success is a story of an international partnership, dedicated teamwork and a perfect blend of human and robotic space operations that will inspire people of all ages. The subsequent servicing missions that enabled the telescope to continue its scientific program beyond its 25th year in orbit are described in a companion volume Enhancing Hubble’s Vision: Service Missions That Expanded Our View of the Universe."

The book then explains why both compounds are distinct from others with similar crystal structure and whether or not one can enhance Tc, which in turn gives a hint on the unresolved pairing mechanism. This is an unprecedented new approach to the problem of high-temperature superconductivity and thus will be inspiring to both specialists and non-specialists interested in this field.   Readers will receive in-depth information on the past, present, and future of high-temperature superconductors, along with special, updated information on what the real highest Tc values are and particularly on the possibility of enhancing Tc for each member material, which is important for application. At this time, the highest Tc has not been improved for 20 years, and no new superconductors have been discovered for 5 years.

Now in its second edition, Enterprise Mac Administrator's Guide addresses the growing size and spread of Mac OS X deployments in corporations and institutions worldwide. In some cases, this is due to the growth of traditional Mac environments, but for the most part it has to do with organizations instituting device choice and switcher campaigns, where Windows and/or Linux environments are migrating to Mac OS X. There is a steep culture shock with many of these migrations. The products that are used are different, the nomenclature is different, and most importantly the best practices for dealing with the operating system and updates are very different. Apple provides a number of tools to help automate and guide IT toward managing a large number of Mac OS X computers-it has since before Mac OS X was initially released. However, if you want to put together all of the pieces to tell a compelling story about how to run an IT department or a deployment of Macs, you need to compile information from a number of different sources.

The first major part of this monograph studies the so-called `qubits' and `qudits', systems with periodic finite lattice as position space. It also discusses the so-called mutually unbiased bases, which have applications in quantum information and quantum cryptography. Quantum logic and its applications to quantum gates is also studied. The second part studies finite quantum systems, where the position takes values in a Galois field. This combines quantum mechanics with Galois theory. The third part extends the discussion to quantum systems with variables in profinite groups, considering the limit where the dimension of the system becomes very large. It uses the concepts of inverse and direct limit and studies quantum mechanics on p-adic numbers. Applications of the formalism include quantum optics and quantum computing, two-dimensional electron systems in magnetic fields and the magnetic translation group, the quantum Hall effect, other areas in condensed matter physics, and Fast Fourier Transforms. The monograph combines ideas from quantum mechanics with discrete mathematics, algebra, and number theory.

The early history of particle physics cannot be distinguished from the history of cosmic rays. With the advent of accelerators, however, the importance of cosmic rays in particle physics was lost. This situation persisted until the 1990s, when novel techniques allowed breakthrough discoveries, and exploration of new physics scales now requires returning to cosmic rays. The new profile of scientists in fundamental physics ideally involves the merging of knowledge in astroparticle and particle physics, but the duration of modern experiments is such that people cannot simultaneously be practitioners in both. Introduction to Particle and Astroparticle Physics is designed to bridge the gap between the fields. It can be used as a self-training book, a consultation book, or a textbook providing a “modern” approach to particles and fundamental interactions",

        "abstract": "In order to analyze the light of cosmic objects, particularly at extremely great distances, spectroscopy is the workhorse of astronomy. In the era of very large telescopes, long-term investigations are mainly performed with small professional instruments. Today they can be done using self-designed spectrographs and highly efficient CCD cameras, without the need for large financial investments.   This book explains the basic principles of spectroscopy, including the fundamental optical constraints and all mathematical aspects needed to understand the working principles in detail. It covers the complete theoretical and practical design of standard and Echelle spectrographs. Readers are guided through all necessary calculations, enabling them to engage in spectrograph design. The book also examines data acquisition with CCD cameras and fiber optics, as well as the constraints of specific data reduction and possible sources of error. In closing it briefly highlights some main aspects of the research on massive stars and spectropolarimetry as an extension of spectroscopy. The book offers a comprehensive introduction to spectroscopy for students of physics and astronomy, as well as a valuable resource for amateur astronomers interested in learning the principles of spectroscopy and spectrograph design",

Read this short, 150-page book that is adapted from Expert Oracle Database Architecture to gain a solid and accurate understanding of how locking and concurrency are dealt with by Oracle Database. Also learn how the Oracle Database architecture accommodates user transactions, and how you can write code to mesh with how Oracle Database is designed to operate. Good transaction design is an important facet of highly-concurrent applications that are run by hundreds, even thousands of users who are all executing transactions at the same time. Transaction design in turn relies upon a good understanding of how the underlying database platform manages of the locking of resources so as to prevent access conflicts and data loss that might otherwise result from concurrent access to data in the database. Oracle Database Transactions and Locking Revealed covers in detail the various lock types, and also different locking schemes such as pessimistic and optimistic locking. Then you’ll learn about transaction isolation and multiversion concurrency, and how the various lock types support Oracle Database’s transactional features. You’ll learn some good tips for transaction design, as well as some bad practices and habits to avoid. Coverage is also given to redo and undo, and their role in concurrency.

            "This textbook for courses on function data analysis and shape data analysis describes how to define, compare, and mathematically represent shapes, with a focus on statistical modeling and inference. It is aimed at graduate students in analysis in statistics, engineering, applied mathematics, neuroscience, biology, bioinformatics, and other related areas. The interdisciplinary nature of the broad range of ideas covered—from introductory theory to algorithmic implementations and some statistical case studies—is meant to familiarize graduate students with an array of tools that are relevant in developing computational solutions for shape and related analyses. These tools, gleaned from geometry, algebra, statistics, and computational science, are traditionally scattered across different courses, departments, and disciplines; Functional and Shape Data Analysis offers a unified, comprehensive solution by integrating the registration problem into shape analysis, better preparing graduate students for handling future scientific challenges. Recently, a data-driven and application-oriented focus on shape analysis has been trending. This text offers a self-contained treatment of this new generation of methods in shape analysis of curves. Its main focus is shape analysis of functions and curves—in one, two, and higher dimensions—both closed and open. It develops elegant Riemannian frameworks that provide both quantification of shape differences and registration of curves at the same time. Additionally, these methods are used for statistically summarizing given curve data, performing dimension reduction, and modeling observed variability. It is recommended that the reader have a background in calculus, linear algebra, numerical analysis, and computation. Presents a complete and detailed exposition on statistical analysis of shapes that includes appendices, background material, and exercises, making this text a self-contained reference Addresses and explores the next generation of shape analysis Focuses on providing a working knowledge of a broad range of relevant material, foregoing in-depth technical details and elaborate mathematical explanations Anuj Srivastava is a Professor in the Department of Statistics and a Distinguished Research Professor at Florida State University.

The aim is to collect material that will help mathematicians already working or wishing to work in this area to deepen their insight and eliminate the technical barriers in this learning process. This also is supported by review articles providing some global picture and an abundance of examples. Additionally, we introduce some material which emphasizes the newly found relationship with the theory of Stein fillings and symplectic geometry. This links two main theories of mathematics: low dimensional topology and algebraic geometry. The theory of normal surface singularities is a distinguished part of analytic or algebraic geometry with several important results, its own technical machinery, and several open problems. Recently several connections were established with low dimensional topology, symplectic geometry and theory of Stein fillings. This created an intense mathematical activity with spectacular bridges between the two areas. The theory of deformation of singularities is the key object in these connections. .",

        "abstract": "Over the next decade, most devices connected to the Internet will not be used by people in the familiar way that personal computers, tablets and smart phones are. Billions of interconnected devices will be monitoring the environment, transportation systems, factories, farms, forests, utilities, soil and weather conditions, oceans and resources. Many of these sensors and actuators will be networked into autonomous sets, with much of the information being exchanged machine-to-machine directly and without human involvement. Machine-to-machine communications are typically terse. Most sensors and actuators will report or act upon small pieces of information - “chirps”. Burdening these devices with current network protocol stacks is inefficient, unnecessary and unduly increases their cost of ownership. This must change. The architecture of theInternet of Things must evolve now byincorporating simpler protocols toward at the edges of thenetwork, or remain forever inefficient. Rethinking the Internet of Things describes reasons why we must rethink current approaches to the Internet of Things. Appropriate architectures that will coexist with existing networking protocols are described in detail. An architecture comprised of integrator functions, propagator nodes, and end devices, along with their interactions, is explored",

The main objective is to describe the dynamic properties of magnetically trapped particles in planetary radiation belts and plasmas and explain the physical processes involved from the theoretical point of view. The approach is to examine in detail the orbital and adiabatic motion of individual particles in typical configurations of magnetic and electric fields in the magnetosphere and, from there, derive basic features of the particles’ collective “macroscopic” behavior in general planetary environments. Emphasis is not on the “what” but on the “why” of particle phenomena in near-earth space, providing a solid and clear understanding of the principal basic physical mechanisms and dynamic processes involved. The book will also serve as an introduction to general space plasma physics, with abundant basic examples to illustrate and explain the physical origin of different types of plasma current systems and their self-organizing character via the magnetic field. The ultimate aim is to help both graduate students and interested scientists to successfully face the theoretical and experimental challenges lying ahead in space physics in view of recent and upcoming satellite missions and an expected wealth of data on radiation belts and plasmas",

            "This monograph covers some of the most important developments in Ramsey theory from its beginnings in the early 20th century via its many breakthroughs to recent important developments in the early 21st century.  The book first presents a detailed discussion of the roots of Ramsey theory before offering a thorough discussion of the role of parameter sets. It presents several examples of structures that can be interpreted in terms of parameter sets and features the most fundamental Ramsey-type results for parameter sets: Hales-Jewett's theorem and Graham-Rothschild¹s Ramsey theorem as well as their canonical versions and several applications. Next, the book steps back to the most basic structure, to sets. It reviews classic results as well as recent progress on Ramsey numbers and the asymptotic behavior of classical Ramsey functions. In addition, the chapter presents product versions of Ramsey's theorem, a combinatorial proof of the incompleteness of Peano arithmetic, provides a digression to discrepancy theory, and examines extensions of Ramsey's theorem to larger cardinals. The next chapter features an in-depth treatment of the Ramsey problem for graphs and hypergraphs. It gives an account on the existence of sparse and restricted Ramsey theorem's using sophisticated constructions as well as probabilistic methods. Among others it contains a proof of the induced Graham-Rothschild theorem and the random Ramsey theorem. The book closes with a chapter on one of the recent highlights of Ramsey theory: a combinatorial proof of the density Hales-Jewett theorem.  This book provides graduate students as well as advanced researchers with a solid introduction and reference to the field. .",

            "This monograph provides an introduction to the concept of invariance entropy, the central motivation of which lies in the need to deal with communication constraints in networked control systems. For the simplest possible network topology, consisting of one controller and one dynamical system connected by a digital channel, invariance entropy provides a measure for the smallest data rate above which it is possible to render a given subset of the state space invariant by means of a symbolic coder-controller pair. This concept is essentially equivalent to the notion of topological feedback entropy introduced by Nair, Evans, Mareels and Moran (Topological feedback entropy and nonlinear stabilization. IEEE Trans. Automat. Control 49 (2004), 1585–1597). The book presents the foundations of a theory which aims at finding expressions for invariance entropy in terms of dynamical quantities such as Lyapunov exponents. While both discrete-time and continuous-time systems are treated, the emphasis lies on systems given by differential equations.",

        "abstract": "Although there are many books on mathematical finance, few deal with the statistical aspects of modern data analysis as applied to financial problems. This book fills this gap by addressing some of the most challenging issues facing any financial engineer. It shows how sophisticated mathematics and modern statistical techniques can be used in concrete financial problems. Concerns of risk management are addressed by the control of extreme values, the fitting of distributions with heavy tails, the computation of values at risk (VaR), and other measures of risk. Data description techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), smoothing, and regression are applied to the construction of yield and forward curve. Nonparametric estimation and nonlinear filtering are used for option pricing and earnings prediction. The book is intended for undergraduate students majoring in financial engineering, or graduate students in a Master in finance or MBA program. Because it was designed as a teaching vehicle, it is sprinkled with practical examples using market data, and each chapter ends with exercises. Practical examples are solved in the computing environment of R. They illustrate problems occurring in the commodity and energy markets, the fixed income markets as well as the equity markets, and even some new emerging markets like the weather markets. The book can help quantitative analysts by guiding them through the details of statistical model estimation and implementation. It will also be of interest to researchers wishing to manipulate financial data, implement abstract concepts, and test mathematical theories, especially by addressing practical issues that are often neglected in the presentation of the theory",

It increases both the speed of a computation and the accuracy of the computed result. With it fast multiple precision arithmetic can be easily provided.

            "This book offers a general introduction to the geometrical studies of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) and his mathematical epistemology. In particular, it focuses on his theory of parallel lines and his attempts to prove the famous Parallel Postulate. Furthermore it explains the role that Leibniz’s work played in the development of non-Euclidean geometry. The first part is an overview of his epistemology of geometry and a few of his geometrical findings, which puts them in the context of the seventeenth-century studies on the foundations of geometry. It also provides a detailed mathematical and philosophical commentary on his writings on the theory of parallels, and discusses how they were received in the eighteenth century as well as their relevance for the non-Euclidean revolution in mathematics. The second part offers a collection of Leibniz’s essays on the theory of parallels and an English translation of them. While a few of these papers have already been published (in Latin) in the standard Leibniz editions, most of them are transcribed from Leibniz’s manuscripts written in Hannover, and published here for the first time. The book provides new material on the history of non-Euclidean geometry, stressing the previously neglected role of Leibniz in these developments. This volume will be of interest to historians in mathematics, philosophy or logic, as well as mathematicians interested in non-Euclidean geometry.",

Each chapter is devoted to a given type of interaction (strain, rotation, shear, etc.), and presents and compares experimental data, numerical results, analysis of the Reynolds stress budget equations and advanced multipoint spectral theories. The role of both linear and non-linear mechanisms is emphasized. The link between the statistical properties and the dynamics of coherent structures is also addressed. Despite its restriction to homogeneous turbulence, the book is of interest to all people working in turbulence, since the basic physical mechanisms which are present in all turbulent flows are explained. The reader will find a unified presentation of the results and a clear presentation of existing controversies. Special attention is given to bridge the results obtained in different research communities. Mathematical tools and advanced physical models are detailed in dedicated chapters.",

The exposition lays out the methods for combining different mathematical structures and tools to effectively build the next model that will accurately reflect real world economic processes. Mathematical modeling of weather phenomena allows us to forecast certain essential weather parameters without any possibility of changing them. By contrast, modeling of transition economies gives us the freedom to not only predict changes in important indexes of all types of economies, but also to influence them more effectively in the desired direction. Simply put: any economy, including a transitional one, can be controlled.

All of the data and example code is available from the Springer website, as well as from Dataverse (http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ARKOTI). The book provides a narrative of how R can be useful for addressing problems common to the analysis of public administration, public policy, and political science data specifically, in addition to the social sciences more broadly. While the book uses data drawn from political science, public administration, and policy analyses, it is written so that students and researchers in other fields should find it accessible and useful as well. Political Analysis Using R is perfect for the first-time R user who has no prior knowledge about the program. By working through the first seven chapters of this book, an entry-level user should be well acquainted with how to use R as a traditional econometric software program. These chapters explain how to install R, open and clean data, draw graphs, compute descriptive statistics, conduct bivariate inferences, and estimate common models such as linear and logistic regression. This portion of the book is ideal for undergraduate students, graduate students, or professionals trying to learn R in their spare time. This book also can be useful for an intermediate R user wishing to develop additional skills within the program. The last four chapters of the book introduce the user to advanced techniques that R offers but many other programs do not make available. Topics in these l ast chapters include: using user-contributed packages, conducting time series analysis, conducting matrix algebra, and writing programs in R",

The book initially focuses on the matrix formulation of non-commutative and fuzzy spaces, followed by a description of the non-perturbative treatment of the corresponding field theories. As an example, the phase structure of non-commutative phi-four theory is treated in great detail, with a separate chapter on the multitrace approach. The last chapter offers a general introduction to non-commutative gauge theories, while two appendices round out the text. Primarily written as a self-study guide for postgraduate students - with the aim of pedagogically introducing them to key analytical and numerical tools, as well as useful physical models in applications - these lecture notes will also benefit experienced researchers by providing a reference guide to the fundamentals of non-commutative field theory with an emphasis on matrix models and fuzzy geometries",

The huge success of quantum mechanics as a predictive theory has been accompanied, from the very beginning, by doubts and controversy about its foundations and interpretation. This book looks in detail at how research on foundations evolved after WWII, when it was revived, until the mid 1990s, when most of this research merged into the technological promise of quantum information. It is the story of the quantum dissidents, the scientists who brought this subject from the margins of physics into its mainstream. It is also a history of concepts, experiments, and techniques, and of the relationships between physics and the world at large, touching on  themes such as the Cold War, McCarthyism, Zhdanovism, and the unrest of the late 1960s",

You will start with a detailed overview of all the security options available for Hadoop, including popular extensions like Kerberos and OpenSSH, and then delve into a hands-on implementation of user security (with illustrated code samples) with both in-the-box features and with security extensions implemented by leading vendors. No security system is complete without a monitoring and tracing facility, so Practical Hadoop Security next steps you through audit logging and monitoring technologies for Hadoop, as well as ready to use implementation and configuration examples--again with illustrated code samples. The book concludes with the most important aspect of Hadoop security - encryption. Both types of encryptions, for data in transit and data at rest, are discussed at length with leading open source projects that integrate directly with Hadoop at no licensing cost.

A central role is played here by a Lie algebra character of the complex Lie algebra consisting of all holomorphic vector fields, which can be intrinsically defined on any compact complex manifold and becomes an obstruction to the existence of a Kähler-Einstein metric. Recent results concerning this character are collected here, dealing with its origin, generalizations, sufficiency for the existence of a Kähler-Einstein metric and lifting to a group character. Other related topics such as extremal Kähler metrics studied by Calabi and others and the existence results of Tian and Yau are also reviewed. As the rudiments of Kählerian geometry and Chern-Simons theory are presented in full detail, these notes are accessible to graduate students as well as to specialists of the subject",

Given the rapid advances in transcendence theory and diophantine approximation over recent years, one might fear that the present work, originally published in Russian in 1982, is mostly superseded. That is not so. A certain amount of updating had been prepared by the author himself before his untimely death. Some further revision was prepared by close colleagues. The first seven chapters provide a detailed, virtually exhaustive, discussion of the theory of lower bounds for linear forms in the logarithms of algebraic numbers and its applications to obtaining upper bounds for solutions to the eponymous classical diophantine equations. The detail may seem stark--- the author fears that the reader may react much as does the tourist on first seeing the centre Pompidou; notwithstanding that, Sprind zuk maintainsa pleasant and chatty approach, full of wise and interesting remarks. His emphases well warrant, now that the book appears in English, close studyand emulation. In particular those emphases allow him to devote the eighth chapter to an analysis of the interrelationship of the class number of algebraic number fields involved and the bounds on the heights of thesolutions of the diophantine equations. Those ideas warrant further development. The final chapter deals with effective aspects of the Hilbert Irreducibility Theorem, harkening back to earlier work of the author. There is no other congenial entry point to the ideas of the last two chapters in the literature",

        "abstract": "For a vector field #3, where Ai are series in X, the algebraic multiplicity measures the singularity at the origin. In this research monograph several strategies are given to make the algebraic multiplicity of a three-dimensional vector field decrease, by means of permissible blowing-ups of the ambient space, i.e. transformations of the type xi=x'ix1, 2<is. A logarithmic point of view is taken, marking the exceptional divisor of each blowing-up and by considering only the vector fields which are tangent to this divisor, instead of the whole tangent sheaf. The first part of the book is devoted to the logarithmic background and to the permissible blowing-ups. The main part corresponds to the control of the algorithms for the desingularization strategies by means of numerical invariants inspired by Hironaka's characteristic polygon. Only basic knowledge of local algebra and algebraic geometry is assumed of the reader. The pathologies we find in the reduction of vector fields are analogous to pathologies in the problem of reduction of singularities in characteristic p. Hence the book is potentially interesting both in the context of resolution of singularities and in that of vector fields and dynamical systems",

This index formula is used to prove a conjecture of Hirzebruch concerning the relation of signature defects of cusps of Hilbert modular varieties and special values of L-series.

The method of proof is to construct certain explicit zeta-integrals of Rankin-Selberg type which interpolate the relevant Langlands L-functions and can be analyzed via the theory of Eisenstein series and intertwining operators.

Part I concentrates on the construction of all the irreducible representations of a multiplicative group B* of a quaternion algebra B over a local field k with residue field of characteristic 2. These results are of considerable significance in the light of the connections found by Jacquet-Langlands between representations of GL2 (k) and B* and although they concern GL2 they also provide a model for GLn. Part II deals with n > 2 unifying results previously obtained by Weil, Jacquet-Langlands, Bernstein-Zelevinskii, Deligne-Kazdan and others. More than a mere comparison of these results, it reveals an intrinsic correspondence found with the aid of the base restriction process of algebraic groups and the substitution of division of algebras for Cartan subalgebras. The approach is purely local and therefore may be applied also to other types of reductive groups, in particular Sp2l as well as to archimedean cases.

It will serve as both an introduction to the subject and also as a comprehensive reference volume for practitioners and researchers. It is organized into six major sections: the nominal categories model, models for response time or multiple attempts on items, models for multiple abilities or cognitive components, nonparametric models, models for nonmonotone items, and models with special assumptions. Each chapter in the book has been written by an expert of that particular topic, and the chapters have been carefully edited to ensure that a uniform style of notation and presentation is used throughout. As a result, all researchers whose work uses item response theory will find this an indispensable companion to their work and it will be the subject's reference volume for many years to come."

            "The purpose of presenting this book to the scholarly world is twofold. In the first place, I wish to provide for the English reader a translation of the earliest extant Arabic work of Hindi arithmetic. It shows this system at its earliest stages and the first steps in its development, a subject not yet well known except for readers of some Arabic publications by the present writer. This book is therefore of particular importance for students of the history of mathematical techniques. The medieval author, AI-UqHdisI, was, it seems, not noticed by bibliographers; neither was his work, which lay hardly noticed by modern scholars until 1960 when I happened to see a microfilm copy of it in the Institute of Arabic Manu­ scripts in Cairo. A steady labour immediately followed to make a comparative study of the text together with over twenty other texts, some of them not yet known to scholars. This pursuit resulted in (i) a doctoral degree awarded to me in 1966 by the University of Khartoum, (ii) the publication of several texts in Arabic including the text here translated, and (iii) the publication of several articles in Arabic and English on the history of arithmetic in the Middle Ages. The second purpose of this book is to make the main results of my study available to the English reader."

            "This book is designed to be a practical progression of experimental techniques an investigator may follow when embarking on a biochemical project. The protocols may be performed in the order laid out or may be used inde­ pendently. The aim of the book is to assist a wide range of researchers. from the novice to the frustrated veteran, in the choice and design of experiments that are to be performed to provide answers to specific questions. The manual describes standard techniques that have been shown to work, as well as some newer ones that are beginning to prove important. By following the promi­ nently numbered steps. you can work your way through any protocol. whether it's a new technique or a task you've done before for which you need a quick review or updated methodology. This manual will assist the experimentalist in designing properly controlled experiments. There will be no advice for dealing with specific pieces of equip­ ment other than encouragement to read the manual, if you can find it. Through­ out all manipulations try to be objective. Be on the lookout for unexpected findings. You will learn the most from unexpected results. and they are often the beginning of the next project. It is never possible to record too much in your lab notebook. Do not get discouraged. Remember, things will not always run smoothly."

What makes this book unique is that it is a brief treatment, yet it covers all the major ideas: the wave equation, the diffusion equation, the Laplace equation, and the advection equation on bounded and unbounded domains. Methods include eigenfunction expansions, integral transforms, and characteristics. Mathematical ideas are motivated from physical problems, and the exposition is presented in a concise style accessible to science and engineering students; emphasis is on motivation, concepts, methods, and interpretation, rather than formal theory. This second edition contains new and additional exercises, and it includes a new chapter on the applications of PDEs to biology: age structured models, pattern formation; epidemic wave fronts, and advection-diffusion processes. The student who reads through this book and solves many of the exercises will have a sound knowledge base for upper division mathematics, science, and engineering courses where detailed models and applications are introduced.

In using the shift operator as a central object, it makes linear algebra a perfect introduction to other areas of mathematics, operator theory in particular. This technique is very powerful as becomes clear from the analysis of canonical forms (Frobenius, Jordan). It should be emphasized that these functional methods are not only of great theoretical interest, but lead to computational algorithms. Quadratic forms are treated from the same perspective, with emphasis on the important examples of Bezoutian and Hankel forms. These topics are of great importance in applied areas such as signal processing, numerical linear algebra, and control theory. Stability theory and system theoretic concepts, up to realization theory, are treated as an integral part of linear algebra. Finally there is a chapter on Hankel norm approximation for the case of scalar rational functions which allows the reader to access ideas and results on the frontier of current research",

        "abstract": "A collection of matrices is said to be triangularizable if there is an invertible matrix S such that S1 AS is upper triangular for every A in the collection. This generalization of commutativity is the subject of many classical theorems due to Engel, Kolchin, Kaplansky, McCoy and others. The concept has been extended to collections of bounded linear operators on Banach spaces: such a collection is defined to be triangularizable if there is a maximal chain of subspaces of the Banach space, each of which is invariant under every member of the collection. Most of the classical results have been generalized to compact operators, and there are also recent theorems in the finite-dimensional case. This book is the first comprehensive treatment of triangularizability in both the finite and infinite-dimensional cases. It contains numerous very recent results and new proofs of many of the classical theorems. It provides a thorough background for research in both the linear-algebraic and operator-theoretic aspects of triangularizability and related areas. More generally, the book will be useful to anyone interested in matrices or operators, as many of the results are linked to other topics such as spectral mapping theorems, properties of spectral radii and traces, and the structure of semigroups and algebras of operators. It is essentially self-contained modulo solid courses in linear algebra (for the first half) and functional analysis (for the second half), and is therefore suitable as a text or reference for a graduate course",

The book is primarily aimed at graduate students and can be used as the text for a graduate course in Bayesian nonparametrics.

        "abstract": "The book is devoted to evolution problems which arise in the dynamics of mechanical systems involving unilateral constraints, possibly in the presence of dry friction. Collisions may be the result. In such a context, the velocity function cannot be expected to be absolutely continuous, so the traditional theory of differential equations or inclusions does not apply. Some effective numerical techniques have been proposed, but existence results were missing until now. This book starts filling that gap. At first, some typical mathematical tools are introduced, such as compactness results in the space of vector functions of bounded variation in time and approximation in the sense of graphs. The sweeping process by a moving convex set in a Hilbert space plays a central role. The latest existence results concerning this process are presented in chapter 2. In chapters 3 and 4, the study of the mechanical problems is undertaken. Connected areas of research are briefly reviewed in chapter 5. Proofs are constructive whenever possible and convergence of algorithms is often considered. The book presupposes only a moderate background in functional analysis",

        "abstract": "Boolean valued analysis is a technique for studying properties of an arbitrary mathematical object by comparing its representations in two different set-theoretic models whose construction utilises principally distinct Boolean algebras. The use of two models for studying a single object is a characteristic of the so-called non-standard methods of analysis. Application of Boolean valued models to problems of analysis rests ultimately on the procedures of ascending and descending, the two natural functors acting between a new Boolean valued universe and the von Neumann universe. This book demonstrates the main advantages of Boolean valued analysis which provides the tools for transforming, for example, function spaces to subsets of the reals, operators to functionals, and vector-functions to numerical mappings. Boolean valued representations of algebraic systems, Banach spaces, and involutive algebras are examined thoroughly.

            "This book is based on lectures given at Yale in 1971-1981 to students prepared with a course in measure-theoretic probability. It contains one technical innovation-probability distributions in which the total probability is infinite. Such improper distributions arise embarras­ singly frequently in Bayes theory, especially in establishing correspondences between Bayesian and Fisherian techniques. Infinite probabilities create interesting complications in defining conditional probability and limit concepts. The main results are theoretical, probabilistic conclusions derived from probabilistic assumptions. A useful theory requires rules for constructing and interpreting probabilities. Probabilities are computed from similarities, using a formalization of the idea that the future will probably be like the past. Probabilities are objectively derived from similarities, but similarities are sUbjective judgments of individuals. Of course the theorems remain true in any interpretation of probability that satisfies the formal axioms. My colleague David Potlard helped a lot, especially with Chapter 13.

A main tool is the theory of Gröbner bases, which is reexamined here from the point of view of geometric deformations.

The algorithmic methods introduced in this book are particularly useful for studying the systems of multidimensional hypergeometric partial differentiel equations introduced by Gel'fand, Kapranov and Zelevinsky. The Gröbner deformation of these GKZ hypergeometric systems reduces problems concerning hypergeometric functions to questions about commutative monomial ideals, and thus leads to an unexpected interplay between analysis and combinatorics.

The first two chapters are introductory, and focus on binary forms and Waring's problem. Then the author's recent work is presented mainly on the representation of forms in three or more variables as sums of powers of relatively few linear forms. The methods used are drawn from seemingly unrelated areas of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, including the theories of determinantal varieties, of classifying spaces of Gorenstein-Artin algebras, and of Hilbert schemes of zero-dimensional subschemes. Of the many concrete examples given, some are calculated with the aid of the computer algebra program \"Macaulay\", illustrating the abstract material. The final chapter considers open problems. This book will be of interest to graduate students, beginning researchers, and seasoned specialists. Prerequisite is a basic knowledge of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry",

Since the early 1990's, when the first commercial meters started to appear, there have been around 2,000 field applications of MFM for field allocation, production optimisation and well testing. So far, many alternative metering systems have been developed, but none of them can be referred to as generally applicable or universally accurate. Both established and novel technologies suitable to measure the flow rates of gas, oil and water in a three-phase flow are reviewed and assessed within this book. Those technologies already implemented in the various commercial meters are evaluated in terms of operational and economical advantages or shortcomings from an operator point of view. The lessons learned about the practical reliability, accuracy and use of the available technology is discussed. The book suggests where the research to develop the next generation of MFM devices will be focused in order to meet the as yet unsolved problems. The book provides a critical and independent review of the current status and future trends of MFM, supported by the authors' strong background on multiphase flow and by practical examples. These are based on the authors' direct experience on MFM, gained over many years of research in connection with both operators and service companies",

        "abstract": "This book deals with central simple Lie algebras over arbitrary fields of characteristic zero. It aims to give constructions of the algebras and their finite-dimensional modules in terms that are rational with respect to the given ground field. All isotropic algebras with non-reduced relative root systems are treated, along with classical anisotropic algebras. The latter are treated by what seems to be a novel device, namely by studying certain modules for isotropic classical algebras in which they are embedded. In this development, symmetric powers of central simple associative algebras, along with generalized even Clifford algebras of involutorial algebras, play central roles. Considerable attention is given to exceptional algebras. The pace is that of a rather expansive research monograph. The reader who has at hand a standard introductory text on Lie algebras, such as Jacobson or Humphreys, should be in a position to understand the results. More technical matters arise in some of the detailed arguments. The book is intended for researchers and students of algebraic Lie theory, as well as for other researchers who are seeking explicit realizations of algebras or modules. It will probably be more useful as a resource to be dipped into, than as a text to be worked straight through",

Should one expect periodic motions which somehow reflect this symmetry? And how would periodicity harmonize with symmetry? Probing into these questions leads from dynamics to topology, algebra, singularity theory, and to many applications. Within a global approach, the emphasis is on periodic motions far from equilibrium. Mathematical methods include bifurcation theory, transversality theory, and generic approximations. A new homotopy invariant is designed to study the global interdependence of symmetric periodic motions. Besides mathematical techniques, the book contains 5 largely nontechnical chapters. The first three outline the main questions, results and methods. A detailed discussion pursues theoretical consequences and open problems. Results are illustrated by a variety of applications including coupled oscillators and rotating waves: these links to such disciplines as theoretical biology, chemistry, fluid dynamics, physics and their engineering counterparts make the book directly accessible to a wider audience",

            "This book describes and discusses the properties of heterogeneous materials. The properties considered include the conductivity (thermal, electrical, magnetic), elastic moduli, dielectrical constant, optical properties, mechanical fracture, and electrical and dielectrical breakdown properties. Both linear and nonlinear properties are considered. The nonlinear properties include those with constitutive nonlinearities as well as threshold nonlinearities, such as brittle fracture and dielectric breakdown. A main goal of this book is to compare two fundamental approaches to describing and predicting materials properties, namely, the continuum mechanics approach and those based on the discrete models. The latter models include the lattice models and the atomistic approaches. The book provides comprehensive and up-to-date theoretical and computer simulation analysis of materials properties. Typical experimental methods for measuring all of these properties are outlined, and comparison is made between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions. Volume I covers linear properties, while volume II considers nonlinear and fracture and breakdown properties, as well as atomistic modeling. This multidisciplinary book will appeal to applied physicists, materials scientists, chemical and mechanical engineers, chemists, and applied mathematicians. Muhammad Sahimi is Professor and Chairman of Chemical Engineering at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, and Adjunct Professor of Physics at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences in Zanjan, Iran.

        "abstract": "&nbsp; The study of random heterogeneous materials is an exciting and rapidly growing multidisciplinary endeavor. This field demands a unified rigorous means of characterizing the microstructures and macroscopic properties of the widely diverse types of heterogeneous materials that abound in nature and synthetic products. This book is the first of its kind to provide such an approach. Emphasis is placed on foundational theoretical methods that can simultaneously yield results of practical utility. The first part of the book deals with the quantitive characterization of the microstructure of heterogeneous materials. The second part of the book treats a wide variety of macroscopic transport, electromagnetic, mechanical, and chemical properties of heterogeneous materials and describes how they are linked to the microstructure of model and real materials. Contemporary topics covered include the statistical mechanics of many-partical systems, the canonical n-point correlation function, percolation theory, computer-simulation methods, image analyses and reconstructions of real materials, homogenization theory, exact property predictions, variational bounds, expansion techniques, and cross property relations. This clear and authoritative volume will be of particular interest to graduate students and researchers in applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, material sciences, engineering, geophysics, and biology. Moreover, the book is self-contained and approachable by nonspecialist. Salvatore Torquato is a professor in the Department of Chemistry and in the Materials Institute at Princeton University. He also holds affiliated appointments at Princeton University in applied and Computational Mathematics Program and in Chemical Engineering.

In Chapter 1 the preliminaries are given. We acquaint the reader with the main ideas of these notes, introduce some useful notations, concepts and abbreviations. He also recall basic facts from ergodic theory, an important mathematical tool employed in these notes. Finally some basic notions from queues are reviewed. Chapter 2 deals with discrete time theory. It serves two purposes. The first one is to let the reader get acquainted with the main lines of the theory needed in continuous time without being bothered by tech­ nical details. However the discrete time theory also seems to be of interest itself. There are examples which have no counte~ in continuous time. Chapter 3 deals with continuous time theory. It also contains many basic results from queueing or dam theory. Three applications of the continuous time theory are given in Chapter 4. We show how to use the theory in order to get some useful bounds for the stationary distribution of a random process."

Despite my almost Confucian attitude of preferring talking (i.e. a transient record) to writing (i.e. a permanent record), the warm encouragement of friends has led to the ensuing notes. I am also only too conscious of the infancy of the methodology introduced in these notes. However, it is my sincere hope that exposure to a wider audience will accelerate its maturity. Readers are assumed to be familiar with the basic theory of time series analysis. The book by Professor M.B. Priestley (1981) may be used as a general reference. Chapter One is addressed to the general question: \"why do we need non-linear time series models?\" After describing some significant advantages of linear models, it singles out several major limitations of linearity. Of course, the selection reflects my personal view on the subject, which is only at its very beginning, although there does seem to be a general agreement in the literature that time irr'eversibility and limit cycles are among the most obvious.",

The people who will be interested in this material are physicists, chemists, economists, and engineers who have to deal with data on a daily basis; consequently, we have included a great deal of introductory and tutorial material. Any person with the equivalent of the mathematics background required for the graduate-level study of physics should be able to follow the material contained in this book, though not without effort. In this work we apply probability theory to the problem of estimating parameters in rather general models. In particular when the model consists of a single stationary sinusoid we show that the direct application of probability theory will yield frequency estimates an order of magnitude better than a discrete Fourier transform in signal-to-noise of one. Latter, we generalize the problem and show that probability theory can separate two close frequencies long after the peaks in a discrete Fourier transform have merged",

Apart from a few exceptions essentially concerning diffusion processes, it is only recently that the relation between the two theories has been thoroughly studied. The authors of this Grundlehren volume, two of the international leaders in the field, propose a systematic exposition of convergence in law for stochastic processes, from the point of view of semimartingale theory, with emphasis on results that are useful for mathematical theory and mathematical statistics. This leads them to develop in detail some particularly useful parts of the general theory of stochastic processes, such as martingale problems, and absolute continuity or contiguity results. The book contains an introduction to the theory of martingales and semimartingales, random measures stochastic integrales, Skorokhod topology, etc., as well as a large number of results which have never appeared in book form, and some entirely new results.

            "The purpose of this book is to give a unified treatment of the limit theory of branching processes. Since the publication of the important book of T E. Harris (Theory of Branching Processes, Springer, 1963) the subject has developed and matured significantly. Many of the classical limit laws are now known in their sharpest form, and there are new proofs that give insight into the results. Our work deals primarily with this decade, and thus has very little overlap with that of Harris. Only enough material is repeated to make the treatment essentially self-contained. For example, certain foundational questions on the construction of processes, to which we have nothing new to add, are not developed. There is a natural classification of branching processes according to their criticality condition, their time parameter, the single or multi-type particle cases, the Markovian or non-Markovian character of the pro­ cess, etc. We have tried to avoid the rather uneconomical and un­ enlightening approach of treating these categories independently, and by a series of similar but increasingly complicated techniques. The basic Galton-Watson process is developed in great detail in Chapters I and II.",

        "abstract": "Special relativity is one of the high points of the undergraduate mathematical physics syllabus. Nick Woodhouse writes for those approaching the subject with a background in mathematics: he aims to build on their familiarity with the foundational material and the way of thinking taught in first-year mathematics courses, but not to assume an unreasonable degree of prior knowledge of traditional areas of physical applied mathematics, particularly electromagnetic theory. His book provides mathematics students with the tools they need to understand the physical basis of special relativity and leaves them with a confident mathematical understanding of Minkowski's picture of space-time. Special Relativity is loosely based on the tried and tested course at Oxford, where extensive tutorials and problem classes support the lecture course. This is reflected in the book in the large number of examples and exercises, ranging from the rather simple through to the more involved and challenging. The author has included material on acceleration and tensors, and has written the book with an emphasis on space-time diagrams. Written with the second year undergraduate in mind, the book will appeal to those studying the 'Special Relativity' option in their Mathematics or Mathematics and Physics course. However, a graduate or lecturer wanting a rapid introduction to special relativity would benefit from the concise and precise nature of the book",

        "abstract": "This monograph discusses Lundberg approximations for compound distributions with special emphasis on applications in insurance risk modeling. These distributions are somewhat awkward from an analytic standpoint, but play a central role in insurance and other areas of applied probability modeling such as queueing theory. Consequently, the material is of interest to researchers and graduate students interested in these areas. The material is self-contained, but an introductory course in insurance risk theory is beneficial to prospective readers. Lundberg asymptotics and bounds have a long history in connection with ruin probabilities and waiting time distributions in queueing theory, and have more recently been extended to compound distributions. This connection has its roots in the compound geometric representation of the ruin probabilities and waiting time distributions. A systematic treatment of these approximations is provided, drawing heavily on monotonicity ideas from reliability theory. The results are then applied to the solution of defective renewal equations, analysis of the time and severity of insurance ruin, and renewal risk models, which may also be viewed in terms of the equilibrium waiting time distribution in the G/G/1 queue. Many known results are derived and extended so that much of the material has not appeared elsewhere in the literature. A unique feature involves the use of elementary analytic techniques which require only undergraduate mathematics as a prerequisite. New proofs of many results are given, and an extensive bibliography is provided. Gordon Willmot is Professor of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo. His research interests are in insurance risk and queueing theory. He is an associate editor of the North American Actuarial Journal",

            "This monograph contains a comprehensive account of the recent work of the authors and other workers on large sample optimal inference for non-ergodic models. The non-ergodic family of models can be viewed as an extension of the usual Fisher-Rao model for asymptotics, referred to here as an ergodic family. The main feature of a non-ergodic model is that the sample Fisher information, appropriately normed, converges to a non-degenerate random variable rather than to a constant. Mixture experiments, growth models such as birth processes, branching processes, etc. , and non-stationary diffusion processes are typical examples of non-ergodic models for which the usual asymptotics and the efficiency criteria of the Fisher-Rao-Wald type are not directly applicable. The new model necessitates a thorough review of both technical and qualitative aspects of the asymptotic theory. The general model studied includes both ergodic and non-ergodic families even though we emphasise applications of the latter type. The plan to write the monograph originally evolved through a series of lectures given by the first author in a graduate seminar course at Cornell University during the fall of 1978, and by the second author at the University of Munich during the fall of 1979. Further work during 1979-1981 on the topic has resolved many of the outstanding conceptual and technical difficulties encountered previously. While there are still some gaps remaining, it appears that the mainstream development in the area has now taken a more definite shape.",

The familiar topics in the dominated case, such as pairwise sufficiency, Neyman factorization, minimal sufficient statistics, and the Rao-Blackwell theorem, are treated from a more general viewpoint than in the Halmos-Savage-Bahadur scheme and sometimes in a slightly different way. The main theme is that if the usual notion of sufficiency in terms of conditional probabilities is modified to omit the standard assumption of a common dominating sigma-finite measure, then certain aspects of statistics become more straightforward. In particular, one can extend Neyman's factorization criterion. Consequently, this will be of interest to researchers in statistics and may even lead to new developments in the theory of sufficiency",

        "abstract": "This book is an extensive and easy to use reference for students and practitioners for finding exact confidence intervals when sampling from finite populations. It can be used by statisticians, engineers, life, physical, and social scientists, quality control personnel, auditors, accountants, and others. The book avoids the need for approximations especially in those cases where many approximations are known to perform poorly. This includes cases where the sample size is small and those cases where certain attributes are rare within the study population. The supporting development and theory of the exact results, provided in the table, are presented in an elementary manner making the book readily useful to a wide audience. While the problem addressed in this book is a common one, the exact solution is not commonly used by many, including statisticians, perhaps because of the involved combinatorics and the required computing. This book removes the need to compute these confidence bounds when sampling from small universes. This book will no doubt serve as a catalyst for research into other exact results and their applications for more complex sampling designs",

It provides a reader with a solid basis in dynamical systems theory, as well as explicit procedures for application of general mathematical results to particular problems. Special attention is given to efficient numerical implementations of the developed techniques. Several examples from recent research papers are used as illustrations. The book is designed for advanced undergraduate or graduate students in applied mathematics, as well as for Ph.D. students and researchers in physics, biology, engineering, and economics who use dynamical systems as model tools in their studies. A moderate mathematical background is assumed, and, whenever possible, only elementary mathematical tools are used.

            "Stratified fluids whose densities, sound speeds and other parameters are functions of a single depth coordinate occur widely in nature. Indeed, the earth's gravitational field imposes a stratification on its atmosphere, oceans and lakes. It is well known that their stratification has a profound effect on the propagation of sound in these fluids. The most striking effect is probably the occurrence of acoustic ducts, due to minima of the sound speed, that can trap sound waves and cause them to propagate hori­ zontally. The reflection, transmission and distortion of sonar signals by acoustic ducts is important in interpreting sonar echoes. Signal scattering by layers of microscopic marine organisms is important to both sonar engi­ neers and marine biologists. Again, reflection of signals from bottom sediment layers overlying a penetrable bottom are of interest both as sources of unwanted echoes and in the acoustic probing of such layers. Many other examples could be given. The purpose of this monograph is to develop from first principles a theory of sound propagation in stratified fluids whose densities and sound speeds are essentially arbitrary functions of the depth. In physical terms, the propagation of both time-harmonic and transient fields is analyzed. The corresponding mathematical model leads to the study of boundary value problems for a scalar wave equation whose coefficients contain the pre­ scribed density and sound speed functions.",

The second is the computer vision community, to present a clear, self-contained, and global overview of the mathematics involved in image processing problems. The book is divided into five main parts. Chapter 1 is a detailed overview. Chapter 2 describes and illustrates most of the mathematical notions found throughout the work. Chapters 3 and 4 examine how PDEs and variational methods can be successfully applied in image restoration and segmentation processes. Chapter 5, which is more applied, describes some challenging computer vision problems, such as sequence analysis or classification.

Technique and computation are given equal prominence with theory. Both rigorous and formal theory is presented --very often in tandem. In practice, the means for a rigorous analysis are not always available. For this reason a goal has been the cultivation of mature formal reasoning.

            "In the end of the last century, Oliver Heaviside inaugurated an operational calculus in connection with his researches in electromagnetic theory. In his operational calculus, the operator of differentiation was denoted by the symbol \"p\". The explanation of this operator p as given by him was difficult to understand and to use, and the range of the valid­ ity of his calculus remains unclear still now, although it was widely noticed that his calculus gives correct results in general. In the 1930s, Gustav Doetsch and many other mathematicians began to strive for the mathematical foundation of Heaviside's operational calculus by virtue of the Laplace transform -pt e f(t)dt. ( However, the use of such integrals naturally confronts restrictions con­ cerning the growth behavior of the numerical function f(t) as t ~ ~. At about the midcentury, Jan Mikusinski invented the theory of con­ volution quotients, based upon the Titchmarsh convolution theorem: If f(t) and get) are continuous functions defined on [O,~) such that the convolution f~ f(t-u)g(u)du =0, then either f(t) =0 or get) =0 must hold. The convolution quotients include the operator of differentiation \"s\" and related operators. Mikusinski's operational calculus gives a satisfactory basis of Heaviside's operational calculus; it can be applied successfully to linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients as well as to the telegraph equation which includes both the wave and heat equa­ tions with constant coefficients.",

The first part provides the basic Riesz-Fredholm theory for equations of the second kind with compact operators in dual systems, including all functional analytic concepts necessary. The second part then illustrates the classical applications of integral equation methods to boundary value problems for the Laplace equation and the heat equation as one of the main historical sources for the development of integral equations, and also introduces Cauchy type singular integral equations. The third part describes the fundamental ideas for the numerical solutions of integral equations. In the final part, ill-posed integral equations of the first kind and their regularization are studied in a Hilbert space setting. So that the book is accessible not only to mathematicians but also to physicists and egineers, it is kept as self-contained as possible, requiring only a solid foundation in differential and integral calculus and, for some parts in complex function theory. Some background in functional analysis will be helpful, but the basic concepts needed are reviewed or developed within the book: the reader must of course be willing to accept the modern functional analytic language for describing the theory and the numerical solution of integral equations",

            "These notes were developed from a course taught at Rice Univ- sity in the spring of 1976 and again at the University of Hawaii in the spring of 1977. It is assumed that the students know some linear algebra and a little about differentiation of vector-valued functions. The idea is to introduce students to some of the concepts of Lie group theory--all done at the concrete level of matrix groups. As much as we could, we motivated developments as a means of deciding when two matrix groups (with different definitions) are isomorphie. In Chapter I \"group\" is defined and examples are given; ho- morphism and isomorphism are defined. For a field k denotes the algebra of n x n matrices over k We recall that A E Mn(k) has an inverse if and only if det A # 0 , and define the general linear group GL(n,k) We construct the skew-field E of quaternions and note that for A E Mn(E) to operate linearlyon Rn we must operate on the right (since we multiply a vector by a scalar n n on the left). So we use row vectors for Rn, c E and write xA , for the row vector obtained by matrix multiplication. We get a complex-valued determinant function on Mn (E) such that det A # 0 guarantees that A has an inverse."

        "abstract": "This text provides an introduction to the numerical solution of initial and boundary value problems in ordinary differential equations on a firm theoretical basis. This book strictly presents numerical analysis as a part of the more general field of scientific computing. Important algorithmic concepts are explained down to questions of software implementation. For initial value problems, a dynamical systems approach is used to develop Runge-Kutta, extrapolation, and multistep methods. For boundary value problems including optimal control problems, both multiple shooting and collocation methods are worked out in detail. Graduate students and researchers in mathematics, computer science, and engineering will find this book useful. Chapter summaries, detailed illustrations, and exercises are contained throughout the book with many interesting applications taken from a rich variety of areas.

        "abstract": "Abelian varieties are a natural generalization of elliptic curves to higher dimensions, whose geometry and classification are as rich in elegant results as in the one-dimensional ease. The use of theta functions, particularly since Mumford's work, has been an important tool in the study of abelian varieties and invertible sheaves on them. Also, abelian varieties play a significant role in the geometric approach to modern algebraic number theory. In this book, Kempf has focused on the analytic aspects of the geometry of abelian varieties, rather than taking the alternative algebraic or arithmetic points of view. His purpose is to provide an introduction to complex analytic geometry. Thus, he uses Hermitian geometry as much as possible. One distinguishing feature of Kempf's presentation is the systematic use of Mumford's theta group. This allows him to give precise results about the projective ideal of an abelian variety. In its detailed discussion of the cohomology of invertible sheaves, the book incorporates material previously found only in research articles. Also, several examples where abelian varieties arise in various branches of geometry are given as a conclusion of the book",

            "The text of this book is derived from courses taught by the author in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. The audience for these courses was composed almost entirely of fourth year undergraduate students majoring in the mathematical sciences. The students had ordinarily completed four semesters of calculus and one of probability. Few had any prior experience with differential equations, stochastic processes, or epidemiology. It also seems prudent to mention that the author's background is in engineering and applied mathematics and not in epidemiology; it is hoped that this is not painfully obvious. The topics covered in this book have in some cases been modified from the way they were originally presented. However, care has been taken to include a suitable amount of material for a one semester course; the temptation to add gratuitous subject matter has been resisted. Similarly, when a choice between clarity and rigor was available, the more easily understood exposition was selected. By looking only at the table of contents, the casual reader could be easily misled into thinking that the main concern of this book is with epidemiology. This is not the case. The purpose of this book is to illustrate the process of formulating and solving mathematical models.",

This book begins with Lie's construction of the space of spheres, including the fundamental notions of oriented contact, parabolic pencils of spheres and Lie sphere transformation. The link with Euclidean submanifold theory is established via the Legendre map. This provides a powerful framework for the study of submanifolds, especially those characterized by restrictions on their curvature spheres. Of particular interest are isoparametric, Dupin and taut submanifolds. These have recently been classified up to Lie sphere transformation in certain special cases through the introduction of natural Lie invariants. The author provides complete proofs of these classifications and indicates directions for further research and wider application of these methods",

        "abstract": "This unique and comprehensive text considers all aspects of heat exchanger fouling from the basic science of how surfaces become fouled to very practical ways of mitigating the problem and from mathematical modelling of different fouling mechanisms to practical methods of heat exchanger cleaning. The problems that restrict the efficient operation of equipment are described and the costs, some of them hidden costs, that are associated with the fouling of heat exchangers are discussed. Some simple concepts and models of the fouling processes are presented as part of the introduction to the subject. Advice on the selection, design, installation and commissioning of heat exchangers to minimise fouling is given. A large part of the text is devoted to the use of chemical and other additives to reduce or eliminate the problem of fouling. Another large section is designed to give information on both on-line and off-line cleaning of heat exchangers. One of the difficulties faced by designers and operators of heat exchangers is anticipating the likely extent of fouling problems to be encountered with different flow streams. Another large section addresses the question and describes methods that have been used in attempting to define fouling potential. The book concludes with a chapter on how fouling information can be obtained using plant data, field tests and laboratory studies",

            "This modern overview to performance analysis places aero- and fluid-dynamic treatments, such as cascade and meridional flow analyses, within the broader context of turbomachine performance analysis. For the first time ducted propellers are treated formally within the general family of turbomachines. It also presents a new approach to the use of dimensional analysis which links the overall requirements, such as flow and head, through velocity triangles to blade element loading and related fluid dynamics within a unifying framework linking all aspects of performance analysis for a wide range of turbomachine types. Computer methods are introduced in the main text and a key chapter on axial turbine performance analysis is complemented by the inclusion of 3 major computer programs on an accompanying disc. These enable the user to generate and modify design data through a graphic interface to assess visually the impact on predicted performance and are designed as a Computer Aided Learning Suite for student project work at the professional designer level. Based on the author's many years of teaching at degree level and extensive research experience, this book is a must for all students and professional engineers involved with turbomachinery"

            "In 1994, W. Richard Stevens and Addison-Wesley published a networking classic: TCP/IP Illustrated. The model for that book was a brilliant, unfettered approach to networking concepts that has proven itself over time to be popular with readers of beginning to intermediate networking knowledge. The Illustrated Network takes this time-honored approach and modernizes it by creating not only a much larger and more complicated network, but also by incorporating all the networking advancements that have taken place since the mid-1990s, which are many. This book takes the popular Stevens approach and modernizes it, employing 2008 equipment, operating systems, and router vendors. It presents an?illustrated? explanation of how TCP/IP works with consistent examples from a real, working network configuration that includes servers, routers, and workstations. Diagnostic traces allow the reader to follow the discussion with unprecedented clarity and precision. True to the title of the book, there are 330+ diagrams and screen shots, as well as topology diagrams and a unique repeating chapter opening diagram. Illustrations are also used as end-of-chapter questions. A complete and modern network was assembled to write this book, with all the material coming from real objects connected and running on the network, not assumptions.

            "Designed for the 21st century classroom, this textbook poses, refines, and analyzes questions of sustainability in a quantitative environment. Building mathematical knowledge in the context of issues relevant to every global citizen today, this text takes an approach that empowers students of all disciplines to understand and reason with quantitative information. Whatever conclusions may be reached on a given topic, this book will prepare the reader to think critically about their own and other people’s arguments and to support them with careful, mathematical reasoning. Topics are grouped in themes of measurement, flow, connectivity, change, risk, and decision-making. Mathematical thinking is at the fore throughout, as students learn to model sustainability on local, regional, and global scales. Exercises emphasize concepts, while projects build and challenge communication skills. With no prerequisites beyond high school algebra, instructors will find this book a rich resource for engaging all majors in the mathematics classroom. From the Foreword No longer will you be just a spectator when people give you quantitative information-you will become an active participant who can engage and contribute new insights to any discussion.[…] There are many math books that will feed you knowledge, but it is rare to see a book like this one that will help you cultivate wisdom.[…] As the authors illustrate, mathematics that pays attention to human considerations can help you look at the world with a new lens, help you frame important questions, and help you make wise decisions.

        "abstract": "Education matters. It is a gateway to prosperity of individuals and economies alike. Integrity in education matters too. Corruption hinders prosperity, causes long-term damage to societies, and diminishes the efficiency of investment in their human potential. Driven by the insight that corruption in education can undermine even the best of intentions, the Republic of Serbia requested the OECD to assess the integrity of its education system – to collect evidence on shortcomings and strengths, to provide a forecast of corruption incidence, and to identify solutions for closing the gaps. This first of its kind integrity report seeks to give pragmatic answers to these queries and support authorities and stakeholders in taking informed decisions on how to strengthen integrity and prevent corruption in the sector. It uses a novel methodology for assessing the integrity of education systems (INTES) to identify the underlying causes of malpractice, and point out areas in need of attention. The report gives a brief overview of education in Serbia and provides a note on the overall integrity climate in the country (Chapter 1). It moves on to identify issues that affect the capacity of the system to ensure fair access (Chapter 2) and deliver satisfactory quality (Chapter 3), to manage resources and staff diligently and professionally (Chapter 4) and to prevent and detect malpractice and corruption (Chapter 5). Chapter 6 contains the recommendations and suggestions for follow-up.",

The questions follow the analytical sequence from elementary understandings to complicated cases, following a step-by-step path towards increased knowledge. The focus is on waves in elastic solids, although some examples also concern non-conservative cases for the sake of completeness. Special attention is paid to the understanding of the influence of microstructure, nonlinearity and internal variables in continua. With the help of many mathematical models for describing waves, physical phenomena concerning wave dispersion, nonlinear effects, emergence of solitary waves, scales and hierarchies of waves as well as the governing physical parameters are analysed. Also, the energy balance in waves and non-conservative models with energy influx are discussed. Finally, all answers are interwoven into the canvas of complexity"

The report is the result of a policy dialogue with more than 100 stakeholders at different levels in Brazil. It assesses the performance of Brazil’s water governance and suggests policy recommendations for strengthening the co-ordination between federal and state water policies and for setting up more robust water allocation regimes that can better cope with future risks.

            "Metastability is a wide-spread phenomenon in the dynamics of non-linear systems - physical, chemical, biological or economic - subject to the action of temporal random forces typically referred to as noise. This monograph provides a concise presentation of mathematical approach to metastability based on potential theory of reversible Markov processes. The authors shed new light on the metastability phenomenon as a sequence of visits of the path of the process to different metastable sets, and focus on the precise analysis of the respective hitting probabilities and hitting times of these sets. The theory is illustrated with many examples, ranging from finite-state Markov chains, finite-dimensional diffusions and stochastic partial differential equations, via mean-field dynamics with and without disorder, to stochastic spin-flip and particle-hopping dynamics and probabilistic cellular automata, unveiling the common universal features of these systems with respect to their metastable behaviour. The monograph will serve both as comprehensive introduction and as reference for graduate students and researchers interested in metastability",

This category of lipid nanoemulsions contains no phospholipids, no proteins nor peptides, no carbohydrates, and no chemical modification of the lipophilic drugs is required; consequently it avoids various past problems reported for earlier versions of targeted nanoemulsions. The book covers in detail the underlying chemical and biochemical principles of stable lipid nanoemulsions as well as many current and potential applications in nanomedicine such as targeted chemotherapy. It is in harmony with goals of the current US National Nanotechnology Initiative, which include nanomedical approaches to drug delivery that focus on developing nanoscale particles to improve drug bioavailability i.e. often using targeted nanoparticles for delivering drugs with cell precision and less side effects.

            "The purpose of this book is to introduce two recent topics in mathematical physics and probability theory: the Schramm–Loewner evolution (SLE) and interacting particle systems related to random matrix theory. A typical example of the latter systems is Dyson's Brownian motion (BM) model. The SLE and Dyson's BM model may be considered as \"children\" of the Bessel process with parameter D, BES(D), and the SLE and Dyson's BM model as \"grandchildren\" of BM. In Chap. 1 the parenthood of BM in diffusion processes is clarified and BES(D) is defined for any D ≥ 1. Dependence of the BES(D) path on its initial value is represented by the Bessel flow. In Chap. 2 SLE is introduced as a complexification of BES(D). Rich mathematics and physics involved in SLE are due to the nontrivial dependence of the Bessel flow on D. From a result for the Bessel flow, Cardy's formula in Carleson's form is derived for SLE. In Chap. 3 Dyson's BM model with parameter β is introduced as a multivariate extension of BES(D) with the relation D = β + 1. The book concentrates on the case where β = 2 and calls this case simply the Dyson model. The Dyson model inherits the two aspects of BES(3); hence it has very strong solvability. That is, the process is proved to be determinantal in the sense that all spatio-temporal correlation functions are given by determinants, and all of them are controlled by a single function called the correlation kernel. From the determinantal structure of the Dyson model, the Tracy–Widom distribution is derived. ."

            "CONTRIBUTED BY DR. ANTHONY C. HEARN THE RAND CORPORATION, SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA REDUCE is a computer program for algebraic computation that IS III world-wide use by thousands of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. Although it traces its beginnings to 1963, until recently it has only been available on main-frame computers because of its relatively large resource requirements. In 1980 I predicted (1) that by the mid-1980's it would be possible to obtain personal computers in the $10,000 $20,000 range capable of running REDUCE. I am therefore delighted to see that machines of the power of the IBM PC can now run this system, even though these computers are more modestly priced than my 1980 vision of the personal algebra machine. In addition to the need for the more widespread access that personal computers can now provide, there has been a longstanding need for a textbook to help the beginning user become better acquainted with the system.

Some of these ideas, in turn, came to combinatorial group theory from low-dimensional topology in the beginning of the 20th Century. This book is divided into three fairly independent parts. Part I provides a brief exposition of several classical techniques in combinatorial group theory, namely, methods of Nielsen, Whitehead, and Tietze. Part II contains the main focus of the book. Here the authors show how the aforementioned techniques of combinatorial group theory found their way into affine algebraic geometry, a fascinating area of mathematics that studies polynomials and polynomial mappings. Part III illustrates how ideas from combinatorial group theory contributed to the theory of free algebras. The focus here is on Schreier varieties of algebras (a variety of algebras is said to be Schreier if any subalgebra of a free algebra of this variety is free in the same variety of algebras)",

Over recent decades, our practical approach to information and its exploitation has radically outpaced our theoretical understanding - to such a degree that reflection on the foundations may seem futile. But it is exactly fields such as quantum information, which are shifting the boundaries of the physically possible, that make a foundational understanding of information increasingly important. One of the recurring themes of the book is the claim by Eddington and Wheeler that information involves interaction and putting agents or observers centre stage. Thus, physical reality, in their view, is shaped by the questions we choose to put to it and is built up from the information residing at its core. This is the root of Wheeler’s famous phrase “it from bit.” After reading the stimulating essays collected in this volume, readers will be in a good position to decide whether they agree with this view."

        "abstract": "Extremes Values, Regular Variation and Point Processes is a readable and efficient account of the fundamental mathematical and stochastic process techniques needed to study the behavior of extreme values of phenomena based on independent and identically distributed random variables and vectors. It presents a coherent treatment of the distributional and sample path fundamental properties of extremes and records. It emphasizes the core primacy of three topics necessary for understanding extremes: the analytical theory of regularly varying functions; the probabilistic theory of point processes and random measures; and the link to asymptotic distribution approximations provided by the theory of weak convergence of probability measures in metric spaces. The book is self-contained and requires an introductory measure-theoretic course in probability as a prerequisite. Almost all sections have an extensive list of exercises which extend developments in the text, offer alternate approaches, test mastery and provide for enjoyable muscle flexing by a reader. The material is aimed at students and researchers in probability, statistics, financial engineering, mathematics, operations research, civil engineering and economics who need to know about: * asymptotic methods for extremes; * models for records and record frequencies; * stochastic process and point process methods and their applications to obtaining distributional approximations; * pervasive applications of the theory of regular variation in probability theory, statistics and financial engineering. \"This book is written in a very lucid way.

            "This book is devoted to the emerging field of techniques for visualizing atomic-scale properties of active catalysts under actual working conditions, i.e. high gas pressures and high temperatures. It explains how to understand these observations in terms of the surface structures and dynamics and their detailed interplay with the gas phase. This provides an important new link between fundamental surface physics and chemistry, and applied catalysis. The book explains the motivation and the necessity of operando studies, and positions these with respect to the more traditional low-pressure investigations on the one hand and the reality of industrial catalysis on the other. The last decade has witnessed a rapid development of new experimental and theoretical tools for operando studies of heterogeneous catalysis. The book has a strong emphasis on the new techniques and illustrates how the challenges introduced by the harsh, operando conditions are faced for each of these new tools. Therefore, one can also read this book as a collection of recipes for the development of operando instruments. At present, the number of scientific results obtained under operando conditions is still limited and mostly focused on a simple test reaction, the catalytic oxidation of CO. This reaction thus forms a natural binding element between the chapters, linking the demonstrations of new techniques, and also connecting the theoretical and experimental studies. Some first results on other reactions are also presented. If there is one thing that can be concluded already in this early stage, it is that the catalytic conditions themselves can have dramatic effects on the structure and composition of the surfaces of catalysts, which, in turn can greatly affect the mechanisms, the activity, and the selectivity of the chemical reactions that they catalyze. ."

A secondary purposed is to give a complete treatment of the properties of the calculus of pseudodifferential boundary problems with transmission, both the first version by Boutet de Monvel (brought completely up to date in this edition) and in version containing a parameter running in an unbounded set. And finally, the book presents some applications to evolution problems, index theory, fractional powers, spectral theory and singular perturbation theory. In this second edition the author has extended the scope and applicability of the calculus wit original contributions and perspectives developed in the years since the first edition. A main improvement is the inclusion of globally estimated symbols, allowing a treatment of operators on noncompact manifolds. Many proofs have been replaced by new and simpler arguments, giving better results and clearer insights. The applications to specific problems have been adapted to use these improved and more concrete techniques. Interest continues to increase among geometers and operator theory specialists in the Boutet de Movel calculus and its various generalizations. Thus the book’s improved proofs and modern points of view will be useful to research mathematicians and to graduate students studying partial differential equations and pseudodifferential operators.

            "Systematically building an optimal theory, this monograph develops and explores several approaches to Hardy spaces in the setting of Ahlfors-regular quasi-metric spaces. The text is broadly divided into two main parts. The first part gives atomic, molecular, and grand maximal function characterizations of Hardy spaces and formulates sharp versions of basic analytical tools for quasi-metric spaces, such as a Lebesgue differentiation theorem with minimal demands on the underlying measure, a maximally smooth approximation to the identity and a Calderon-Zygmund decomposition for distributions. These results are of independent interest. The second part establishes very general criteria guaranteeing that a linear operator acts continuously from a Hardy space into a topological vector space, emphasizing the role of the action of the operator on atoms. Applications include the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for elliptic systems in the upper-half space with boundary data from Hardy spaces. The tools established in the first part are then used to develop a sharp theory of Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces in Ahlfors-regular quasi-metric spaces. The monograph is largely self-contained and is intended for an audience of mathematicians, graduate students and professionals with a mathematical background who are interested in the interplay between analysis and geometry"

        "abstract": "Cities in Sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing rapid population growth. Yet their economic growth has not kept pace. Why? One factor might be low capital investment, due in part to Africa's relative poverty: Other regions have reached similar stages of urbanization at higher per capita GDP. This study, however, identifies a deeper reason: African cities are closed to the world. Compared with other developing cities, cities in Africa produce few goods and services for trade on regional and international markets. To grow economically as they are growing in size, Africa's cities must open their doors to the world. They need to specialize in manufacturing, along with other regionally and globally tradable goods and services. And to attract global investment in tradables production, cities must develop scale economies, which are associated with successful urban economic development in other regions. Such scale economies can arise in Africa, and they will-if city and country leaders make concerted efforts to bring agglomeration effects to urban areas. Today, potential urban investors and entrepreneurs look at Africa and see crowded, disconnected, and costly cities. Such cities inspire low expectations for the scale of urban production and for returns on invested capital. How can these cities become economically dense-not merely crowded? How can they acquire efficient connections? And how can they draw firms and skilled workers with a more affordable, livable urban environment? From a policy standpoint, the answer must be to address the structural problems affecting African cities. Foremost among these problems are institutional and regulatory constraints that misallocate land and labor, fragment physical development, and limit productivity. As long as African cities lack functioning land markets and regulations and early, coordinated infrastructure investments, they will remain local cities: closed to regional and global markets, trapped into producing only locally traded goods and services, and limited in their economic growth",

A new method of p-adic interpolation of these critical values is presented. An important class of p-adic L-functions treated in the present book are p-adic L-functions of Siegel modular forms having logarithmic growth (which were first introduced by Amice, Velu and Vishik in the elliptic modular case when they come from a good supersingular reduction of ellptic curves and abelian varieties). The given construction of these p-adic L-functions uses precise algebraic properties of the arihmetical Shimura differential operator.

The philosophy behind the book is to start with real world raw datasets and perform all the analytical steps needed to reach final results. Though theory plays an important role, this is a practical book for advanced undergraduate and graduate classes in bioinformatics, genomics and statistical genetics or for use in lab sessions. This book is also designed to be used by students in computer science and statistics who want to learn the practical aspects of genomic analysis without delving into algorithmic details. The datasets used throughout the book may be downloaded from the publisher’s website.  Chapters show how to handle and manage high-throughput genomic data, create automated workflows and speed up analyses in R. A wide range of R packages useful for working with genomic data are illustrated with practical examples. In recent years R has become the de facto tool for analysis of gene expression data, in addition to its prominent role in the analysis of genomic data. Benefits to using R include the integrated development environment for analysis, flexibility and control of the analytic workflow.  At a time when genomic data is decidedly big, the skills from this book are critical. The key topics covered are association studies, genomic prediction, estimation of population genetic parameters and diversity, gene expression analysis, functional annotation of results using publically available databases and how to work efficiently in R with large genomic datasets. Important principles are demonstrated and illustrated through engaging examples which invite the reader to work with the provided datasets. Some methods that are discussed in this volume include: signatures of selection; population parameters (LD, FST, FIS, etc); use of a genomic relationship matrix for population diversity studies; use of SNP data for parentage testing; snpBLUP and gBLUP for genomic prediction. Step-by-step, all the R code required for a genome-wide association study is shown: starting from raw SNP data, how to build databases to handle and manage the data, quality control and filtering measures, association testing and evaluation of results, through to identification and functional annotation of candidate genes. Similarly, gene expression analyses are shown using microarray and RNAseq data.",

Instead of the standard \"transition\" approach to teaching proofs, wherein students are taught fundamentals of logic, given some common proof strategies such as mathematical induction, and presented with a series of well-written proofs to mimic, this textbook teaches what a student needs to be thinking about when trying to construct a proof. Covering the fundamentals of analysis sufficient for a typical beginning Real Analysis course, it never loses sight of the fact that its primary focus is about proof writing skills. This book aims to give the student precise training in the writing of proofs by explaining exactly what elements make up a correct proof, how one goes about constructing an acceptable proof, and, by learning to recognize a correct proof, how to avoid writing incorrect proofs. To this end, all proofs presented in this text are preceded by detailed explanations describing the thought process one goes through when constructing the proof. Over 150 example proofs, templates, and axioms are presented alongside full-color diagrams to elucidate the topics at hand.",

Apart from these general prerequisites, the text is as self-contained as possible.

            "The second edition of this highly praised textbook provides an expanded introduction to the theory of ordered sets and its connections to various subjects. Utilizing a modular presentation, the core material is purposely kept brief, allowing for the benefits of a broad exposure to the subject without the risk of overloading the reader with too much information all at once. The remaining chapters can then be read in almost any order, giving the text a greater depth and flexibility of use. Most topics are introduced by examining how they relate to research problems, some of them still open, allowing for continuity among diverse topics and encouraging readers to explore these problems further with research of their own. A wide range of material is presented, from classical results such as Dilworth's, Szpilrajn's, and Hashimoto's Theorems to more recent results such as the Li-Milner Structure Theorem. Major topics covered include chains and antichains, lowest upper and greatest lower bounds, retractions, algorithmic approaches, lattices, the dimension of ordered sets, interval orders, lexicographic sums, products, enumeration, and the role of algebraic topology. This new edition shifts the primary focus to finite ordered sets, with results on infinite ordered sets presented toward the end of each chapter whenever possible. Also new are Chapter 6 on graphs and homomorphisms, which serves to separate the fixed clique property from the more fundamental fixed simplex property as well as to discuss the connections and differences between graph homomorphisms and order-preserving maps, and an appendix on discrete Morse functions and their use for the fixed point property for ordered sets. Rich in examples, diagrams, and exercises, the second edition of Ordered Sets will be an excellent text for undergraduate and graduate students and a valuable resource for interested researchers. It will be especially useful to those looking for an introduction to the theory of ordered sets and its connections to such areas as algebraic topology, analysis, and computer science. PRAISE FOR THE FIRST EDITION \"The author has done the field a service by producing an excellent text strong in the presentation of certain topological aspects of the underlying diagrams, e.g., which should serve the developing community and field well and which can be recommended without reservations as one of the volumes which should grace a poseteer's library whether she is interested only or mainly in the theory of these objects or has directed her gaze towards applications. As a sourcebook of ideas and understanding it will make its mark. And deservedly so.\" — ZENTRALBLATT MATH “…A gem. Undergraduate mathematics and computer science majors will find the first chapters offering background that will serve them well in many courses. The rest of the book, which features many open problems, constitutes an accessible and stimulating invitation to research . . . Highly recommended.\" — CHOICE “The author presents the field of ordered sets in an attractive way and the many open problems presented in the book are invaluable...[T]he book is a success, it presents an in depth and up to date carefully written coverage of ordered sets.\" —SIGACT NEWS."

            "This textbook takes the reader on a tour of the most important landmarks of theoretical physics: classical, quantum, and statistical mechanics, relativity, electrodynamics, as well as the most modern and exciting of all: elementary particles and the physics of fractals. The second edition has been supplemented with a new chapter devoted to concise though complete presentation of dynamical systems, bifurcations and chaos theory. The treatment is confined to the essentials of each area, presenting all the central concepts and equations at an accessible level. Chapters 1 to 4 contain the standard material of courses in theoretical physics and are supposed to accompany lectures at the university; thus they are rather condensed. They are supposed to fill one year of teaching. Chapters 5 and 6, in contrast, are written less condensed since this material may not be part of standard lectures and thus could be studied without the help of a university teacher. An appendix on elementary particles lies somewhere in between: It could be a summary of a much more detailed course, or studied without such a course. Illustrations and numerous problems round off this unusual textbook. It will ideally accompany the students all along their course in theoretical physics and prove indispensable in preparing and revising the exams. It is also suited as a reference for teachers or scientists from other disciplines who are interested in the topic."

            "This monograph aims to provide a unified, geometrical foundation of gauge theories of elementary particle physics. The underlying geometrical structure is unfolded in a coordinate-free manner via the modern mathematical notions of fibre bundles and exterior forms. Topics such as the dynamics of Yang-Mills theories, instanton solutions and topological invariants are included. By transferring these concepts to local space-time symmetries, generalizations of Einstein's theory of gravity arise in a Riemann-Cartan space with curvature and torsion. It provides the framework in which the (broken) Poincaré gauge theory, the Rainich geometrization of the Einstein-Maxwell system, and higher-dimensional, non-abelian Kaluza-Klein theories are developed. Since the discovery of the Higgs boson, concepts of spontaneous symmetry breaking in gravity have come again into focus, and, in this revised edition, these will be exposed in geometric terms. Quantizing gravity remains an open issue: formulating it as a de Sitter type gauge theory in the spirit of Yang-Mills, some new progress in its topological form is presented. After symmetry breaking, Einstein’s standard general relativity with cosmological constant emerges as a classical background. The geometrical structure of BRST quantization with non-propagating topological ghosts is developed in some detail.",

We consider the classical elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic linear equations, but also the diffusion, transport, and Navier-Stokes equations, as well as equations representing conservation laws, saddle-point problems and optimal control problems. Furthermore, we provide numerous physical examples which underline such equations. We then analyze numerical solution methods based on finite elements, finite differences, finite volumes, spectral methods and domain decomposition methods, and reduced basis methods. In particular, we discuss the algorithmic and computer implementation aspects and provide a number of easy-to-use programs. The text does not require any previous advanced mathematical knowledge of partial differential equations: the absolutely essential concepts are reported in a preliminary chapter. It is therefore suitable for students of bachelor and master courses in scientific disciplines, and recommendable to those researchers in the academic and extra-academic domain who want to approach this interesting branch of applied mathematics",

            "This book presents a detailed description of the development of statistical theory. In the mid twentieth century, the development of mathematical statistics underwent an enduring change, due to the advent of more refined mathematical tools. New concepts like sufficiency, superefficiency, adaptivity etc. motivated scholars to reflect upon the interpretation of mathematical concepts in terms of their real-world relevance. Questions concerning the optimality of estimators, for instance, had remained unanswered for decades, because a meaningful concept of optimality (based on the regularity of the estimators, the representation of their limit distribution and assertions about their concentration by means of Anderson’s Theorem) was not yet available. The rapidly developing asymptotic theory provided approximate answers to questions for which non-asymptotic theory had found no satisfying solutions. In four engaging essays, this book presents a detailed description of how the use of mathematical methods stimulated the development of a statistical theory. Primarily focused on methodology, questionable proofs and neglected questions of priority, the book offers an intriguing resource for researchers in theoretical statistics, and can also serve as a textbook for advanced courses in statistics"

            "Troubleshoot the most widespread and pernicious Java performance problems using a set of open-source and freely-available tools that will make you dramatically more productive in finding the root causes of slow performance. This is a brief book that focuses on a small number of performance anti-patterns, and you’ll find that most problems you encounter fit into one of these anti-patterns. The book provides a specific method in a series of steps referred to as the “P.A.t.h. Checklist” that encompasses persistence, alien systems, threads, and heap management. These steps guide you through a troubleshooting process that is repeatable, that you can apply to any performance problem in a Java application. This technique is especially helpful in 'dark' environments with little monitoring. Performance problems are not always localized to Java, but often fall into the realms of database access and server load. This book gives attention to both of these issues through exa mples showing how to identify repetitive SQL, and identify architecture-wide performance problems ahead of production rollout. Learn how to apply load like an expert, and determine how much load to apply to determine whether your system scales. Included are walk-throughs of a dozen server-side performance puzzles that are ready to run on your own machine. Following these examples helps you learn to: Assess the performance health of four main problems areas in a Java system: The P.A.t.h. Checklist presents each area with its own set of plug-it-in-now tools Pinpoint the code at fault for CPU and other bottlenecks without a Java profiler Find memory leaks in just minutes using heapSpank, the author's open-source leak detector utility that is freely available from heapSpank.org The repeatable method provided in this book is an antidote to lackluster average response times that are multi-second throughout the industry. This book prov ides a long absent, easy-to-follow, performance training regimen that will benefit anyone programming in Java.  What You Will Learn: Avoid the 6 most common ways to mess up a load test Determine the exact number of threads to dial into the load generator to test your system's scalability Detect the three most common SQL performance anti-patterns Measure network response times of calls to back-end systems ('alien systems') Identify whether garbage collection performance is healthy or unhealthy and whether delays are caused by problems in the old or new generation, so ..."

            "This book takes the reader on a journey through the world of college mathematics, focusing on some of the most important concepts and results in the theories of polynomials, linear algebra, real analysis, differential equations, coordinate geometry, trigonometry, elementary number theory, combinatorics, and probability. Preliminary material provides an overview of common methods of proof: argument by contradiction, mathematical induction, pigeonhole principle, ordered sets, and invariants. Each chapter systematically presents a single subject within which problems are clustered in each section according to the specific topic. The exposition is driven by nearly 1300 problems and examples chosen from numerous sources from around the world; many original contributions come from the authors. The source, author, and historical background are cited whenever possible. Complete solutions to all problems are given at the end of the book. This second edition includes new sections on quadratic polynomials, curves in the plane, quadratic fields, combinatorics of numbers, and graph theory, and added problems or theoretical expansion of sections on polynomials, matrices, abstract algebra, limits of sequences and functions, derivatives and their applications, Stokes' theorem, analytical geometry, combinatorial geometry, and counting strategies. Using the W.L. Putnam Mathematical Competition for undergraduates as an inspiring symbol to build an appropriate math background for graduate studies in pure or applied mathematics, the reader is eased into transitioning from problem-solving at the high school level to the university and beyond, that is, to mathematical research. This work may be used as a study guide for the Putnam exam, as a text for many different problem-solving courses, and as a source of problems for standard courses in undergraduate mathematics. Putnam and Beyond is organized for independent study by undergraduate and graduate students, as well as teachers and researchers in the physical sciences who wish to expand their mathematical horizons. Reviews of the first edition: The reviewer recommends this book to all students curious about the force of mathematics, especially those who are bored at school and ready for a challenge. Teachers would find this book to be a welcome resource, as will contest organizers. -Teodora-Liliana Radulescu, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1122 (24), 2007   …This extraordinary book can be read for fun.

            "This biography explores the life and career of the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, which is also the story of thirty years that transformed physics and forever changed our understanding of matter and the universe: nuclear physics and elementary particle physics were born, nuclear fission was discovered, the Manhattan Project was developed, the atomic bombs were dropped, and the era of “big science” began. It would be impossible to capture the full essence of this revolutionary period without first understanding Fermi, without whom it would not have been possible. Enrico Fermi: The Obedient Genius attempts to shed light on all aspects of Fermi’s life - his work, motivation, influences, achievements, and personal thoughts - beginning with the publication of his first paper in 1921 through his death in 1954. During this time, Fermi demonstrated that he was indeed following in the footsteps of Galileo, excelling in his work both theoretically and experimentally by deepening our understanding of the Pauli exclusion principle, winning the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the fundamental properties of slow neutrons, developing the theory of beta decay, building the first nuclear reactor, and playing a central role in the development of the atomic bomb. Interwoven with this fascinating story, the book details the major developments in physics and provides the necessary background material to fully appreciate the dramatic changes that were taking place. Also included are appendices that provide a timeline of Fermi’s life, several primary source documents from the period, and an extensive bibliography. This book will enlighten anyone interested in Fermi’s work or the scientific events that led to the physics revolution of the first half of the twentieth century.",

            "This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to nature-inspired metaheuristic methods for search and optimization, including the latest trends in evolutionary algorithms and other forms of natural computing. Over 100 different types of these methods are discussed in detail. The authors emphasize non-standard optimization problems and utilize a natural approach to the topic, moving from basic notions to more complex ones. An introductory chapter covers the necessary biological and mathematical backgrounds for understanding the main material. Subsequent chapters then explore almost all of the major metaheuristics for search and optimization created based on natural phenomena, including simulated annealing, recurrent neural networks, genetic algorithms and genetic programming, differential evolution, memetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, artificial immune systems, ant colony optimization, tabu search and scatter search, bee and bacteria foraging algorithms, harmony search, biomolecular computing, quantum computing, and many others. General topics on dynamic, multimodal, constrained, and multiobjective optimizations are also described. Each chapter includes detailed flowcharts that illustrate specific algorithms and exercises that reinforce important topics. Introduced in the appendix are some benchmarks for the evaluation of metaheuristics. Search and Optimization by Metaheuristics is intended primarily as a textbook for graduate and advanced undergraduate students specializing in engineering and computer science. It will also serve as a valuable resource for scientists and researchers working in these areas, as well as those who are interested in search and optimization methods.",

These can either take the form of state space models or be represented by an input-output equation.

            "This book evaluates and suggests potentially critical improvements to causal set theory, one of the best-motivated approaches to the outstanding problems of fundamental physics. Spacetime structure is of central importance to physics beyond general relativity and the standard model. The causal metric hypothesis treats causal relations as the basis of this structure. The book develops the consequences of this hypothesis under the assumption of a fundamental scale, with smooth spacetime geometry viewed as emergent. This approach resembles causal set theory, but differs in important ways; for example, the relative viewpoint, emphasizing relations between pairs of events, and relationships between pairs of histories, is central. The book culminates in a dynamical law for quantum spacetime, derived via generalized path summation.",

In most applications of lasers, such as cutting and engraving, the laser source is brought to the point of service where the laser beam is needed to perform its function. However, in some important applications such as remote atmospheric sensing, placing the laser at a convenient location is not an option. Current sensing schemes rely on the detection of weak backscattering of ground-based, forward-propagating optical probes, and possess limited sensitivity. The concept of air lasing (or atmospheric lasing) relies on the idea that the constituents of the air itself can be used as an active laser medium, creating a backward-propagating, impulsive, laser-like radiation emanating from a remote location in the atmosphere. This book provides important insights into the current state of development of air lasing and its applications."

This manual describes a new methodology to measure what constitutes a decent but basic standard of living and how much workers need to earn to afford this, making it possible for researchers to estimate comparable living wages around the world and determine gaps between living wages and prevailing wages. The new, practical methodology in this manual draws on 10 years of research and experience to clearly explain each step in the estimation process, based on standards for a low-cost nutritious diet, healthy housing, and all other needs including decent health care and children's education. It stresses transparency and the need for time- and place-specific living wage estimates, and is replete with examples from country studies that have put it to the test. The authors describe how living wages can be estimated in locations and countries where secondary data are limited and make new, practical recommendations on how to value in kind benefits as partial payment of a living wage An essential tool for global sustainability standards, researchers, NGOs, governments and international organizations interested in wages, estimating realistic poverty lines, formulating policies for reducing poverty and income inequality, and improving livelihoods and international trade agreements.

This is the fourth book dedicated to distance sampling. In the decade since the last book published, there have been a number of new developments. The intervening years have also shown which advances are of most use. This self-contained book covers topics from the previous publications, while also including recent developments in method, software and application. Distance sampling refers to a suite of methods, including line and point transect sampling, in which animal density or abundance is estimated from a sample of distances to detected individuals. The book illustrates these methods through case studies; data sets and computer code are supplied to readers through the book’s accompanying website.  Some of the case studies use the software Distance, while others use R code. The book is in three parts.  The first part addresses basic methods, the design of surveys, distance sampling experiments, field methods and data issues.  The second part develops a range of modelling approaches for distance sampling data.  The third part describes variations in the basic method; discusses special issues that arise when sampling different taxa (songbirds, seabirds, cetaceans, primates, ungulates, butterflies, and plants); considers advances to deal with failures of the key assumptions; and provides a check-list for those conducting surveys.",

Whatever version of Windows you’re using (including Windows 10) you’ll likely need to maintain compatibility with older software that the company must use for mission-critical operations, or older hardware that’s required for specific purposes, but you don’t want to sacrifice security for the sake of compatibility. In this briefbook you’ll learn how to maintain optimal compatibility with the older software and devices that you need to use. The authors are well-versed in training in classrooms and video, with Andrew Bettany running the IT Academy at the University of York, and IT Masterclasses and Mike Halsey being a teacher, tech-book author, and having produced many tutorial videos under the brand PC Support.tv",

        "abstract": "This book starts with a discussion of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, bifurcation theory and Hamiltonian dynamics. It then embarks on a systematic discussion of the traditional topics of modern nonlinear dynamics  -- integrable systems, Poincaré maps, chaos, fractals and strange attractors. The Baker’s transformation, the logistic map and Lorenz system are discussed in detail in view of their central place in the subject. There is a detailed discussion of solitons centered around the Korteweg-deVries equation in view of its central place in integrable systems. Then, there is a discussion of the Painlevé property of nonlinear differential equations which seems to provide a test of integrability. Finally, there is a detailed discussion of the application of fractals and multi-fractals to fully-developed turbulence -- a problem whose understanding has been considerably enriched by the application of the concepts and methods of modern nonlinear dynamics. On the application side, there is a special emphasis on some aspects of fluid dynamics and plasma physics reflecting the author’s involvement in these areas of physics. A few exercises have been provided that range from simple applications to occasional considerable extension of the theory. This book has grown out of the author’s lecture notes for an interdisciplinary graduate-level course on nonlinear dynamics. The basic concepts, language and results of nonlinear dynamical systems are described in a clear and coherent way. In order to allow for an interdisciplinary readership, an informal style has been adopted and the mathematical formalism has been kept to a minimum. This book is addressed to first-year graduate students in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering, and is useful also to any theoretically inclined researcher in the physical sciences and engineering. This second edition constitutes an extensive rewrite of the text involving refinement and enhancement of the clarity and precision, updating and amplification of several sections, addition of new material like theory of nonlinear differential equations, solitons, Lagrangian chaos in fluids, and critical phenomena perspectives on the fluid turbulence problem and many new exercises",

You will explore each distro, step by step, so that you don't have to endure hours of web surfing, countless downloads, confusion from foreign concepts and, at worst, reading complex and long-winded installation guides. You will benefit from the author's long-term experience of working hands-on with each Linux distro, enabling you to choose the best distro for your long-term needs. The first barrier that a new Linux user has to face is the overwhelming number of \"flavors\" of this operating system. These varieties are commonly known as distros (from distribution), and to date there are more than three hundred active Linux distros from which you may choose. So, how do you choose just one? You can choose the most popular at the moment, or take a friend or colleague’s advice. But are you sure that it is the one that you really need?

            "This book presents thermal field theory techniques, which can be applied in both cosmology and the theoretical description of the QCD plasma generated in heavy-ion collision experiments. It focuses on gauge interactions (whether weak or strong), which are essential in both contexts. As well as the many differences in the physics questions posed and in the microscopic forces playing a central role, the authors also explain the similarities and the techniques, such as the resummations, that are needed for developing a formally consistent perturbative expansion. The formalism is developed step by step, starting from quantum mechanics; introducing scalar, fermionic and gauge fields; describing the issues of infrared divergences; resummations and effective field theories; and incorporating systems with finite chemical potentials. With this machinery in place, the important class of real-time (dynamic) observables is treated in some detail. This is followed by an overview of a number of applications, ranging from the study of phase transitions and particle production rate computations, to the concept of transport and damping coefficients that play a ubiquitous role in current developments. The book serves as a self-contained textbook on relativistic thermal field theory for undergraduate and graduate students of theoretical high-energy physics. ."

            "Rafelski presents Special Relativity in a language deemed accessible to students without any topical preparation - avoiding the burden of geometry, tensor calculus, and space-time symmetries – and yet advancing in highly contemporary context all the way to research frontiers. Special Relativity is presented such that nothing remains a paradox or just apparent, but rather is explained. A text of similar character, content, and scope, has not been available before. This book describes Special Relativity when rigid material bodies are introduced describing the reality of body contraction; it shows the relevance of acceleration and the necessary evolution of the theoretical framework when acceleration is critical. This book also presents the evolving views of Einstein about the aether. In addition to a careful and elementary introduction to relativity complete with exercises, worked examples and many discussions, this volume connects to current research topics so that readers can explore Special Relativity from the foundation to the frontier. Johann Rafelski is a theoretical physicist working at The University of Arizona in Tucson, USA. Born in 1950 in Krakow, Poland, he received his Ph.D. with Walter Greiner at University Frankfurt, Germany in 1973. In 1977 Rafelski arrived at CERN-Geneva, where with Rolf Hagedorn he developed the search for quark-gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collision as a novel research domain. He invented and developed the strangeness quark flavor as the signature of quark-gluon plasma, advancing the discovery of this new phase of primordial matter. Professor Rafelski also has held professional appointments at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago, the University of Frankfurt, the University of Cape Town, the University of Paris-Jussieu, and the Ecole Polytechnique. He has been a DFG Excellence Initiative Professor at Ludwig-Maximillian University Munich. In collaboration with researchers from the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris and ELI-Beamlines in Prague he is using ultra-intense lasers in nuclear and fundamental physics. Prof. Rafelski is the editor of the open-access book: Melting Hadrons, Boiling Quarks - From Hagedorn Temperature to Ultra-Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions at CERN - With a Tribute to Rolf Hagedorn (Springer, 2016)."

            "This textbook, based on three series of lectures held by the author at the University of Strasbourg, presents functional analysis in a non-traditional way by generalizing elementary theorems of plane geometry to spaces of arbitrary dimension. This approach leads naturally to the basic notions and theorems. Most results are illustrated by the small ℓp spaces. The Lebesgue integral, meanwhile, is treated via the direct approach of Frigyes Riesz, whose constructive definition of measurable functions leads to optimal, clear-cut versions of the classical theorems of Fubini-Tonelli and Radon-Nikodým. Lectures on Functional Analysis and the Lebesgue Integral presents the most important topics for students, with short, elegant proofs. The exposition style follows the Hungarian mathematical tradition of Paul Erdős and others. The order of the first two parts, functional analysis and the Lebesgue integral, may be reversed. In the third and final part they are combined to study various spaces of continuous and integrable functions. Several beautiful, but almost forgotten, classical theorems are also included. Both undergraduate and graduate students in pure and applied mathematics, physics and engineering will find this textbook useful. Only basic topological notions and results are used and various simple but pertinent examples and exercises illustrate the usefulness and optimality of most theorems. Many of these examples are new or difficult to localize in the literature, and the original sources of most notions and results are indicated to help the reader understand the genesis and development of the field."

It also describes relaxation theory of non-stationary Markov periodic in time systems. The theory of finite and infinite transport in disordered networks, with a discussion of the issue of anomalous diffusion is introduced.

This book takes a radically different tack, not as a rhetorical stance, but as the basis for fruitful empirical analysis. The studies here show that public service organizations and their leaders can be innovative in their own right. The contributions made here provide insights that will productively inform future research and practice. Ian Miles, University of Manchester, UK This book is devoted to the study of public-private innovation networks in services (ServPPINs). These are a new type of innovation network which have rapidly developed in service economies. ServPPINs are collaborations between public and private service organizations, their objective being the development of new and improved services which encompass both technological and non-technological innovations. The book presents in-depth empirical research from different service sectors across Europe in order to explore the nature of these publicprivate collaborations. It elucidates the processes of formation, entrepreneurship and management, the types of innovations ServPPINs generate, and the nature of the public policies required to support them.

For such functionals, criteria are developed under which there exists a minimum action curve leading from one given set to another. Then the properties of this curve are studied, and the non-existence of minimizers is established in some settings. Applied to a geometric reformulation of the quasipotential of Wentzell-Freidlin theory (a subfield of large deviation theory), these results can yield the existence and properties of maximum likelihood transition curves between two metastable states in a stochastic process with small noise.

            "This reference text, now in its second edition, offers a modern unifying presentation of three basic areas of nonlinear analysis: convex analysis, monotone operator theory, and the fixed point theory of nonexpansive operators. Taking a unique comprehensive approach, the theory is developed from the ground up, with the rich connections and interactions between the areas as the central focus, and it is illustrated by a large number of examples. The Hilbert space setting of the material offers a wide range of applications while avoiding the technical difficulties of general Banach spaces. The authors have also drawn upon recent advances and modern tools to simplify the proofs of key results making the book more accessible to a broader range of scholars and users. Combining a strong emphasis on applications with exceptionally lucid writing and an abundance of exercises, this text is of great value to a large audience including pure and applied mathematicians as well as researchers in engineering, data science, machine learning, physics, decision sciences, economics, and inverse problems. The second edition of Convex Analysis and Monotone Operator Theory in Hilbert Spaces greatly expands on the first edition, containing over 140 pages of new material, over 270 new results, and more than 100 new exercises. It features a new chapter on proximity operators including two sections on proximity operators of matrix functions, in addition to several new sections distributed throughout the original chapters. Many existing results have been improved, and the list of references has been updated. Heinz H.

            "This course-based primer offers readers a concise introduction to the description of quantum mechanical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom - and quantum spin systems in particular - using the operator algebraic approach. Here, the observables are modeled using elements of some operator algebra, usually a C*-algebra. This text introduces readers to the framework and the necessary mathematical tools without assuming much mathematical background, making it more accessible than advanced monographs. The book also highlights the usefulness of the so-called thermodynamic limit of quantum spin systems, which is the limit of infinite system size. For example, this makes it possible to clearly distinguish between local and global properties, without having to keep track of the system size. Together with Lieb-Robinson bounds, which play a similar role in quantum spin systems to that of the speed of light in relativistic theories, this approach allows ideas from relativistic field theories to be implemented in a quantum spin system. Several related cases are discussed, demonstrating the merits of the operator algebraic approach. Featuring representative worked-out examples and many exercises, this text is primarily targeted at graduate students and advanced undergraduates in theoretical physics or mathematics with a keen interest in mathematical physics. The material provides the necessary background and pointers to start exploring the recent literature. As such, it will also be useful for active researchers seeking a quick and comparatively self-contained introduction to the operator algebraic approach to quantum spin systems",

            "This book is intended for students of computational systems biology with only a limited background in mathematics. Typical books on systems biology merely mention algorithmic approaches, but without offering a deeper understanding. On the other hand, mathematical books are typically unreadable for computational biologists. The authors of the present book have worked hard to fill this gap. The result is not a book on systems biology, but on computational methods in systems biology. This book originated from courses taught by the authors at Freie Universität Berlin. The guiding idea of the courses was to convey those mathematical insights that are indispensable for systems biology, teaching the necessary mathematical prerequisites by means of many illustrative examples and without any theorems. The three chapters cover the mathematical modelling of biochemical and physiological processes, numerical simulation of the dynamics of biological networks, and identification of model parameters by means of comparisons with real data. Throughout the text, the strengths and weaknesses of numerical algorithms with respect to various systems biological issues are discussed. Web addresses for downloading the corresponding software are also included."

If understanding statistics isn’t your strongest suit, you are not especially mathematically-inclined, or if you are wary of computers, this is the right book for you.  Excel, a widely available computer program for students and managers, is also an effective teaching and learning tool for quantitative analyses in social science courses.  Its powerful computational ability and graphical functions make learning statistics much easier than in years past.  However, Excel 2013 for Social Science Statistics: A Guide to Solving Practical Problems is the first book to capitalize on these improvements by teaching students and managers how to apply Excel to statistical techniques necessary in their courses and work. Each chapter explains statistical formulas and directs the reader to use Excel commands to solve specific, easy-to-understand social science problems.  Practice problems are provided at the end of each chapter with their solutions in an Appendix.  Separately, there is a full Practice Test (with answers in an Appendix) that allows readers to test what they have learned.

            "This book is primarily concerned with the computational aspects of predictability of dynamical systems – in particular those where observation, modeling and computation are strongly interdependent. Unlike with physical systems under control in laboratories, for instance in celestial mechanics, one is confronted with the observation and modeling of systems without the possibility of altering the key parameters of the objects studied. Therefore, the numerical simulations offer an essential tool for analyzing these systems. With the widespread use of computer simulations to solve complex dynamical systems, the reliability of the numerical calculations is of ever-increasing interest and importance. This reliability is directly related to the regularity and instability properties of the modeled flow. In this interdisciplinary scenario, the underlying physics provide the simulated models, nonlinear dynamics provides their chaoticity and instability properties, and the computer sciences provide the actual numerical implementation. This book introduces and explores precisely this link between the models and their predictability characterization based on concepts derived from the field of nonlinear dynamics, with a focus on the finite-time Lyapunov exponents approach. The method is illustrated using a number of well-known continuous dynamical systems, including the Contopoulos, Hénon-Heiles and Rössler systems. To help students and newcomers quickly learn to apply these techniques, the appendix provides descriptions of the algorithms used throughout the text and details how to implement them in order to solve a given continuous dynamical system.",

Due to permeation of digital infrastructures, software, and digital media in everyday life, many aspects of contemporary culture and society are infused with the activity and practice of classification. That means that old questions about classification have their potency in modern discourses about surveillance, identify formation, big data and so on. At the same time, this situation also implies a need to reconsider these old questions and how to frame them in digital culture. This book contains contributions that consider classic library classification practices and how their choices have social, cultural and political effect, how the organization of knowledge is not only a professional practice but is also a way of communicating and understanding digital culture, and how what a particular historical context perceives as information has implications for the recording of that information.",

This book, based on a successful course taught at MIT, is divided pedagogically into three parts: (I) Electronic Structure, (II) Transport Properties, and (III) Optical Properties. Each topic is explained in the context of bulk materials and then extended to low-dimensional materials where applicable. Problem sets review the content of each chapter to help students to understand the material described in each of the chapters more deeply and to prepare them to master the next chapters."

            "This book covers all topics in mechanics from elementary Newtonian mechanics, the principles of canonical mechanics and rigid body mechanics to relativistic mechanics and nonlinear dynamics. It was among the first textbooks to include dynamical systems and deterministic chaos in due detail. As compared to the previous editions the present 6th edition is updated and revised with more explanations, additional examples and problems with solutions, together with new sections on applications in science.   Symmetries and invariance principles, the basic geometric aspects of mechanics as well as elements of continuum mechanics also play an important role. The book will enable the reader to develop general principles from which equations of motion follow, to understand the importance of canonical mechanics and of symmetries as a basis for quantum mechanics, and to get practice in using general theoretical concepts and tools that are essential for all branches of physics.   The book contains more than 150 problems with complete solutions, as well as some practical examples which make moderate use of personal computers. This will be appreciated in particular by students using this textbook to accompany lectures on mechanics. The book ends with some historical notes on scientists who made important contributions to the development of mechanics."

The notion of convexity covered here is considerably broader than the classic one; specifically, it is not restricted to the context of vector spaces. Classical concepts of order-convex sets (Birkhoff) and of geodesically convex sets (Menger) are directly inspired by intuition; they go back to the first half of this century. An axiomatic approach started to develop in the early Fifties. The author became attracted to it in the mid-Seventies, resulting in the present volume, in which graphs appear side-by-side with Banach spaces, classical geometry with matroids, and ordered sets with metric spaces. A wide variety of results has been included (ranging for instance from the area of partition calculus to that of continuous selection). The tools involved are borrowed from areas ranging from discrete mathematics to infinite-dimensional topology. Although addressed primarily to the researcher, parts of this monograph can be used as a basis for a well-balanced, one-semester graduate course",

            "This book offers a detailed and stimulating account of the Lagrangian, or variational, approach to general relativity and beyond. The approach more usually adopted when describing general relativity is to introduce the required concepts of differential geometry and derive the field and geodesic equations from purely geometrical properties. Demonstration of the physical meaning then requires the weak field approximation of these equations to recover their Newtonian counterparts. The potential downside of this approach is that it tends to suit the mathematical mind and requires the physicist to study and work in a completely unfamiliar environment. In contrast, the approach to general relativity described in this book will be especially suited to physics students. After an introduction to field theories and the variational approach, individual sections focus on the variational approach in relation to special relativity, general relativity, and alternative theories of gravity. Throughout the text, solved exercises and examples are presented. The book will meet the needs of both students specializing in theoretical physics and those seeking a better understanding of particular aspects of the subject.",

            "These course-tested lectures provide a technical introduction to Supersymmetric Grand Unified Theories (SUSY GUTs), as well as a personal view on the topic by one of the pioneers in the field. While the Standard Model of Particle Physics is incredibly successful in describing the known universe it is, nevertheless, an incomplete theory with many free parameters and open issues. An elegant solution to all of these quandaries is the proposed theory of SUSY GUTs. In a GUT, quarks and leptons are related in a simple way by the unifying symmetry and their electric charges are quantized, further the relative strength of the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces are predicted. SUSY GUTs additionally provide a framework for understanding particle masses and offer candidates for dark matter. Finally, with the extension of SUSY GUTs to string theory, a quantum-mechanically consistent unification of the four known forces (including gravity) is obtained. The book is organized in three sections: the first section contains a brief introduction to the Standard Model, supersymmetry and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Then SUSY GUTs in four space-time dimensions are introduced and reviewed. In addition, the cosmological issues concerning SUSY GUTs are discussed. Then the requirements for embedding a 4D SUSY GUT into higher-dimensional theories including gravity (i.e. String Theory) are investigated. Accordingly, section two of the course is devoted to discussing the so-called Orbifold GUTs and how in turn they solve some of the technical problems of 4D SUSY GUTs. Orbifold GUTs introduce a new set of open issues, which are then resolved in the third section in which it is shown how to embed Orbifold GUTs into the E(8) x E(8) Heterotic String in 10 space-time dimensions"

This book specifically considers basic models of the nonlinear dynamics of molecular systems and discusses relevant applications in biological physics and the polymer sciences. Emphasis is placed on specific solutions to the dynamical equations that correspond to the coherent formation of spatial-temporal structures, such as solitons, kinks and breathers, in particular. The emergence of these patterns in molecular structures provides a variety of information on their structural properties and plays a significant part in energy transfer processes, topological defects, dislocations, and related structure transitions. Real media, in which solitons take the form of solitary waves, are also considered. In this context, the formation of nonlinear waves in a continuous medium described by nonlinear equations is associated with spontaneous breaking of the local symmetry of the homogeneous system, which produces a range of interesting phenomena. A particular feature of this text is its combination of analytic and computational strategies to tackle difficult nonlinear problems at the molecular level of matter",

            "This monograph presents a general mechanical theory for biological growth. It provides both a conceptual and a technical foundation for the understanding and analysis of problems arising in biology and physiology. The theory and methods is illustrated on a wide range of examples and applications. A process of extreme complexity, growth plays a fundamental role in many biological processes and is considered to be the hallmark of life itself. Its description has been one of the fundamental problems of life sciences, but until recently, it has not attracted much attention from mathematicians, physicists, and engineers. The author herein presents the first major technical monograph on the problem of growth since D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson’s 1917 book On Growth and Form. The emphasis of the book is on the proper mathematical formulation of growth kinematics and mechanics. Accordingly, the discussion proceeds in order of complexity and the book is divided into five parts. First, a general introduction on the problem of growth from a historical perspective is given. Then, basic concepts are introduced within the context of growth in filamentary structures. These ideas are then generalized to surfaces and membranes and eventually to the general case of volumetric growth. The book concludes with a discussion of open problems and outstanding challenges. Thoughtfully written and richly illustrated to be accessible to readers of varying interests and background, the text will appeal to life scientists, biophysicists, biomedical engineers, and applied mathematicians alike"

            "In this largely nontechnical book, eminent physicists and philosophers address the philosophical impact of recent advances in quantum physics. These are shown to shed new light on profound questions about realism, determinism, causality or locality. The participants contribute in the spirit of an open and honest discussion, reminiscent of the time when science and philosophy were inseparable. After the editors’ introduction, the next chapter reveals the strangeness of quantum mechanics and the subsequent discussions examine our notion of reality. The spotlight is then turned to the topic of decoherence. Bohm’s theory is critically examined in two chapters, and the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics is likewise described and discussed. The penultimate chapter presents a proposal for resolving the measurement problem, and finally the topic of loop quantum gravity is presented by one of its founding fathers, Carlo Rovelli. The original presentations and discussions on which this volume is based took place under the auspices of the French “Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques”. The book will appeal to everybody interested in knowing how our description of the world is impacted by the results of the most powerful and successful theory that physicists have ever built.",

The reader will be presented with an old, but persistent problem of this field: The contradiction between Prompt Fission Neutron (PFN) spectra measured with differential (microscopic) experiments and integral (macroscopic and benchmark) experiments (the Micro-Macro problem). The difference in average energy is rather small ~3% but it is stable and we cannot explain the difference due to experimental uncertainties. Can we measure the PFN spectrum with high accuracy? How may we compare results of different experiments to provide better accuracy? Are our traditional theoretical models correct? What can be done to solve the Micro-Macro problem in future?

            "The book considers foundational thinking in quantum theory, focusing on the role the fundamental principles and principle thinking there, including thinking that leads to the invention of new principles, which is, the book contends, one of the ultimate achievements of theoretical thinking in physics and beyond. The focus on principles, prominent during the rise and in the immediate aftermath of quantum theory, has been uncommon in more recent discussions and debates concerning it. The book argues, however, that exploring the fundamental principles and principle thinking is exceptionally helpful in addressing the key issues at stake in quantum foundations and the seemingly interminable debates concerning them. Principle thinking led to major breakthroughs throughout the history of quantum theory, beginning with the old quantum theory and quantum mechanics, the first definitive quantum theory, which it remains within its proper (nonrelativistic) scope. It has, the book also argues, been equally important in quantum field theory, which has been the frontier of quantum theory for quite a while now, and more recently, in quantum information theory, where principle thinking was given new prominence. The approach allows the book to develop a new understanding of both the history and philosophy of quantum theory, from Planck’s quantum to the Higgs boson, and beyond, and of the thinking the key founding figures, such as Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Dirac, as well as some among more recent theorists. The book also extensively considers the nature of quantum probability, and contains a new interpretation of quantum mechanics, “the statistical Copenhagen interpretation.” Overall, the book’s argument is guided by what Heisenberg called “the spirit of Copenhagen,” which is defined by three great divorces from the preceding foundational thinking in physics—reality from realism, probability from causality, and locality from relativity—and defined the fundamental principles of quantum theory accordingly.",

        "abstract": "Food insecurity and malnutrition are major international concerns, especially in rural areas. At the global scale, they have received considerable attention and investment, but the results achieved so far have been mixed. Some countries have made progress at the national level, but still have many citizens who are food insecure, often concentrated in specific geographic areas. Food insecurity and poverty are highly interlinked and have a strong territorial dimension. To provide effective long-term solutions, policy responses must therefore be tailored to the specific challenges of each territory, taking into account a multidimensional response that includes food availability, access, utilisation and stability. This report highlights five case studies and the OECD New Rural Paradigm, presenting an effective framework for addressing food insecurity and malnutrition.",

            "In this monograph, the authors present their recently developed theory of electromagnetic interactions. This neoclassical approach extends the classical electromagnetic theory down to atomic scales and allows the explanation of various non-classical phenomena in the same framework. While the classical Maxwell–Lorentz electromagnetism theory succeeds in describing the physical reality at macroscopic scales, it struggles at atomic scales. Here, quantum mechanics traditionally takes over to describe non-classical phenomena such as the hydrogen spectrum and de Broglie waves. By means of modifying the classical theory, the approach presented here is able to consistently explain quantum-mechanical effects, and while similar to quantum mechanics in some respects, this neoclassical theory also differs markedly from it. In particular, the newly developed framework omits probabilistic interpretations of the wave function and features a new fundamental spatial scale which, at the size of the free electron, is much larger than the classical electron radius and is relevant to plasmonics and emission physics. This book will appeal to researchers interested in advanced aspects of electromagnetic theory. Treating the classical approach in detail, including non-relativistic aspects and the Lagrangian framework, and comparing the neoclassical theory with quantum mechanics and the de Broglie–Bohm theory, this work is completely self-contained.",

        "abstract": "This review is the first in a new series on the skills and labour market integration of immigrants and their children. With 16% of its population born abroad, Sweden has one of the larger immigrant populations among the European OECD countries. Estimates suggest that about half of the foreign-born population originally came to Sweden as refugees or as the family of refugees and Sweden has been the OECD country that has had by far the largest inflows of asylum seekers relative to its population. In all OECD countries, humanitarian migrants and their families face greater challenges to integrate into the labour market than other groups. It is thus not surprising that immigrant versus native-born differences are larger than elsewhere, which also must be seen in the context of high skills and labour market participation among the native-born. For both genders, employment disparities are particularly pronounced among the low-educated, among whom immigrants are heavily overrepresented. These immigrants face particular challenges related to the paucity of low-skilled jobs in Sweden, and policy needs to acknowledge that their integration pathway tends to be a long one. Against this backdrop, Sweden has highly developed and longstanding integration policies that mainly aim at upskilling immigrants while temporarily lowering the cost of hiring, while other tools that work more strongly with the social partners and the civil society are less well developed and need strengthening.",

            "\"The most common approach to adaptive optics (AO), as originally employed in astronomical telescopes, has been to use a wavefront sensor to measure directly aberrations. In situations where such sensing provides reliable measurement, this is clearly the ideal method (see Chapter 2), but this approach has limitations,and particularly so in the context of microscopy. In order to understand this, one should consider the constraints the use of a wavefront sensor places on the nature of the optical conguration. A wavefront is only well de ned in particular situations, for example when light is emitted by a small or distant, point-like object, such as a star for a telescope or a minuscule bead in a microscope. In these situations, a wavefront sensor provides a clear and reliable measurement and this phenomenon has been used to great effect, as explained in Chapter 2. However, not all sources of light have these necessary properties. For example, a large luminous object comprises an arrangement of individual emitters, each of which produces its associated wavefront. In this case, a wavefront sensor would respond to all of the light impinging upon it, thus giving potentially ambiguous measurements. In an extreme case, such as where light is emitted throughout the volume of the specimen, the sensor would be swamped with light and thus be un-able to provide sensible aberration measurement. For this reason, in microscopy, direct wavefront sensing has been e ective where point-like sources have been employed, either through the introduction of uorescent beads [1, 2], or using localised uorescent markers [3] and non-linear excited guide stars [4, 5, 6]\"--Provided by publisher"

It offers a concise but comprehensive overview of a number of topics, like general relativity, fission and fusion, which are otherwise only available with much more detail in other textbooks. Providing a general introduction to the underlying concepts (relativity, fission and fusion, fundamental forces), it allows readers to develop an idea of what these two research fields really involve. The book uses real-world examples to make the subject more attractive and encourage the use of mathematical formulae. Besides short scientists' biographies, diagrams, end-of-chapter problems and worked solutions are also included. Intended mainly for students of scientific disciplines such as physics and chemistry who want to learn about the subject and/or the related techniques, it is also useful to high school teachers wanting to refresh or update their knowledge and to interested non-experts",

His artistic talent, associated with a great intellectual curiosity and with a genuine passion for the experimentation of new construction systems, led Valle to develop an architectural work resolutely open and multiform. Whether in the smaller towns of Friuli and Veneto or in metropolitan centres as New York, Paris or Berlin, Valle realized a wide range of important works: social housing and banks, factories and offices, town halls and courthouses.

        "abstract": "Accounting for the astonishing developments in the field of Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology, this second edition has been updated and substantially expanded. Starting with the description of our home galaxy, the Milky Way, this cogently written textbook introduces the reader to the astronomy of galaxies, their structure, active galactic nuclei, evolution and large scale distribution in the Universe. After an extensive and thorough introduction to modern observational and theoretical cosmology, the focus turns to the formation of structures and astronomical objects in the early Universe. The basics of classical astronomy and stellar astrophysics needed for extragalactic astronomy are provided in the appendix. The new edition incorporates some of the most spectacular results from new observatories like the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Herschel, ALMA, WMAP and Planck, as well as new instruments and multi-wavelength campaigns which have expanded our understanding of the Universe and the objects populating it. This includes new views on the galaxy population in the nearby Universe, on elliptical galaxies, as well as a deeper view of the distant Universe approaching the dark ages, and an unprecedented view of the distant dusty Universe. Schneider also discusses the impressive support for the standard model of the Universe, which has been substantially strengthened by recent results, including baryon acoustic oscillations (an approach which has significantly matured over the years), results from the completed WMAP mission and from the first Planck results, which have confirmed and greatly improved on these findings, not least by measuring the gravitational lensing effect on the microwave background. Further, a new chapter focusing on galaxy evolution illustrates how well the observations of distant galaxies and their central supermassive black holes can be understood in a general framework of theoretical ideas, models, and numerical simulations. Peter Schneider’s Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology offers fundamental information on this fascinating subfield of astronomy, while leading readers to the forefront of astronomical research. But it seeks to accomplish this not only with extensive textual information and insights; the author’s own passion for exploring the workings of the Universe, which can be seen in the text and the many supporting color illustrations, will further inspire the reader.

        "abstract": "To see objects that live in the fourth dimension we humans would need to add a fourth dimension to our three-dimensional vision. An example of such an object that lives in the fourth dimension is a hyper-sphere or “3-sphere”. The quest to imagine the elusive 3-sphere has deep historical roots: medieval poet Dante Alighieri, in his circa 1300 AD Divine Comedy, used a 3-sphere to convey his allegorical vision of the Christian afterlife. In 1917, Albert Einstein visualized the universe, at each instant in time, as a 3-sphere. He described his representation as “…the place where the reader’s imagination boggles. Nobody can imagine this thing.” Over time, however, our understanding of the concept of dimension evolved. By 2003, a researcher had successfully rendered into human vision the structure of a 4-web (think of an every increasingly-dense spider’s web). In this text Stephen Lipscomb takes his innovative dimension theory research a step further, using the 4-web to reveal a new partial image of a 3-sphere. Illustrations support the reader’s understanding of the mathematics behind this process. Lipscomb describes a computer program that can produce partial images of a 3-sphere and suggests methods of discerning other fourth-dimensional objects that may serve as the basis for future artwork.  Reviews The author’s notion of fractal-based computer art is fascinating-a clear expression of our technological age. With the color plates in this book and the available DVD animation the reader will not only substantiate this, but will also gain an intuitive sense about the nature of fractals and about the structure and origin of the 4-web. A.D. Parks, Ph.D., Principal Scientist, Head of Quantum Physics Group, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Virginia Using numerous illustrations, the author discusses the idea of a fourth dimension. The new feature here is his use of an object that up until recently lived only in the fourth dimension. This book should become useful, educational, and widely-read. Gerald Edgar, Professor (Emeritus) of Mathematics, The Ohio State University  I have read many books, but only a couple has been as suggestive in terms of connections between mathematics, art, and physics as this book.

        "abstract": "This book presents the basics and advanced topics of research of gamma ray physics. It describes measuring of  Fermi surfaces with gamma resonance spectroscopy and the theory of angular distributions of resonantly scattered gamma rays. The dependence of excited-nuclei average lifetime on the shape of the exciting-radiation spectrum and electron binding energies in the spectra of scattered gamma rays is described. Resonant excitation by gamma rays of nuclear isomeric states with long lifetime leads to the emission and absorption lines. In the book, a new gamma spectroscopic method, gravitational gamma spectrometry, is developed. It has a resolution hundred million times higher than the usual Mössbauer spectrometer. Another important topic of this book is resonant scattering of annihilation quanta by nuclei with excited states in connection with positron annihilation. The application of the methods described is to explain the phenomenon of Coulomb fragmentation of gamma-source molecules and resonant scattering of annihilation quanta to study the shape of Fermi surfaces of metals",

            "Presenting the first unified treatment of limit theorems for multiple sums of independent random variables, this volume fills an important gap in the field. Several new results are introduced, even in the classical setting, as well as some new approaches that are simpler than those already established in the literature. In particular, new proofs of the strong law of large numbers and the Hajek-Renyi inequality are detailed. Applications of the described theory include Gibbs fields, spin glasses, polymer models, image analysis and random shapes. Limit theorems form the backbone of probability theory and statistical theory alike. The theory of multiple sums of random variables is a direct generalization of the classical study of limit theorems, whose importance and wide application in science is unquestionable. However, to date, the subject of multiple sums has only been treated in journals. The results described in this book will be of interest to advanced undergraduates, graduate students and researchers who work on limit theorems in probability theory, the statistical analysis of random fields, as well as in the field of random sets or stochastic geometry. The central topic is also important for statistical theory, developing statistical inferences for random fields, and also has applications to the sciences, including physics and chemistry"

After giving a detailed introduction to Janet bases and Thomas decomposition, the problem of finding an implicit description of certain sets of analytic functions in terms of differential equations is addressed. Effective methods of varying generality are developed to solve the differential elimination problems that arise in this context. In particular, it is demonstrated how the symbolic solution of partial differential equations profits from the study of the implicitization problem. For instance, certain families of exact solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations can be computed",

            "This publication focuses on care professionals' health in home care. It examines the impact of preparing and post-processing communication structures on the well-being of employees. Such structures are understood as the totality of formal and informal communication instruments and practices. These include, for example, handoff structures and documentation structures. In order to create a scientific basis for the analysis, an overview of the framework conditions and job requirements in the sector will be given and theoretical principles of stress will be presented. Subsequently, models for the development of stress are applied to preparing and post-processing communication structures. The analysis shows that the design of preparing and post-processing communication structures has an effect on nursing staff's ability to cope with work requirements and thus has a considerable influence on their health. There is a need for action to strengthen resources and minimize stressors - for example in the area of social support through personal communication. Furthermore, it becomes apparent that nursing staff should be involved in the design of structures. Finally, possible effects of the investigated structures will be worked out on individual as well as on social level to show the importance of the topic.",

            "This book is dedicated to the study of the term structures of the yields of zero-coupon bonds. The methods it describes differ from those usually found in the literature in that the time variable is not the term to maturity but the interest rate duration, or another convenient non-linear transformation of terms. This makes it possible to consider yield curves not only for a limited interval of term values, but also for the entire positive semiaxis of terms. The main focus is the comparative analysis of yield curves and forward curves and the analytical study of their features. Generalizations of yield term structures are studied where the dimension of the state space of the financial market is increased. In cases where the analytical approach is too cumbersome, or impossible, numerical techniques are used. This book will be of interest to financial analysts, financial market researchers, graduate students and PhD students",

        "abstract": "Measuring innovation in education and understanding how it works is essential to improve the quality of the education sector. Monitoring systematically how pedagogical practices evolve would considerably increase the international education knowledge base. We need to examine whether, and how, practices are changing within classrooms and educational organisations and how students use learning resources. We should know much more about how teachers change their professional development practices, how schools change their ways to relate to parents, and, more generally, to what extent change and innovation are linked to better educational outcomes. This would help policy makers to better target interventions and resources, and get quick feedback on whether reforms do change educational practices as expected. This would enable us to better understand the role of innovation in education. This new edition of Measuring Innovation in Education examines what has (or has not) changed for students over the past decade in OECD education systems. It reviews no fewer than 150 educational practices. The report casts light on systemic innovation in primary and secondary education, with a focus on pedagogical innovation. Has the use of technology spread? Have assessments become more important in pedagogical practices? Are students given more agency in their learning? Are they still asked to memorise facts and procedures? Do teachers increasingly engage students in peer learning activities? These are some of the questions this book seeks to answer. This report also presents some preliminary findings about the links between innovation and educational performance. This book will offer precious insights to policy makers, the education community and all those who seek to understand how educational practices are evolving.",

        "abstract": "Over the timespan of just one generation the planet's pace of urbanization has dramatically increased. Through these dynamics and its resulting environmental threats, new challenges have emerged that deeply question the validity of the post-war planning paradigms. Dominant ideologies have been replaced by a problem-solving attitude, increased economic pressure and an urgent quest for evidence. What impact does this have on the work of the urban designer and planner, and how can the profession prepare for the future? 'Designing Change' tries to answer these and many other questions through in-depth conversations with 12 leading practitioners in the field : Christopher Choa (AECOM), Bruno Fortier (Agence Bruno Fortier), Finn Geipel (LIN) Adriaan Geuze (West 8), Djamel Klouche (AUC), Winy Maas (MVRDV) Dennis Pieprz (Sasaki Associates), Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk (DPZ), Albert Speer (AS+P) with Michael Denkel, Paola Viganò (Studio Paola Viganò), Liu Xiaodu (Urbanus) with Wang Hui, Wenyi Zhu (ZhuWenyi-Atelier). Conceived as an unpartisan contribution to the discourse about the future of the built environment, 'Designing Change' offers an unorthodox combination of case-study analysis and theoretical debate. It addresses the topic's complexity through a rigorous focus on process, client relationship and development initiative",

What economic, environmental, and social conditions are necessary for an upscaling of earth to occur? In the future, cement, the most important component of concrete, will – as well as other finite resources – become less viable to produce and significantly more expensive. Considering appropriate alternatives for building materials is becoming imperative. This book presents a wide scope of built and unbuilt projects as well as strategies that can be implemented to edify processes of building, adapting the use of earth to each unique culture and context. Using impressive examples, the authors demonstrate groundbreaking technological innovations that highlight the advantages of this material: from its worldwide availability to the possibility of comprehensive recycling, from climate-neutral production to socially just implementation, including a focus on emerging economies.

            "Understanding dissipative dynamics of open quantum systems remains a challenge in mathematical physics. This problem is relevant in various areas of fundamental and applied physics. From a mathematical point of view, it involves a large body of knowledge. Significant progress in the understanding of such systems has been made during the last decade. These books present in a self-contained way the mathematical theories involved in the modeling of such phenomena. They describe physically relevant models, develop their mathematical analysis and derive their physical implications. In Volume I the Hamiltonian description of quantum open systems is discussed. This includes an introduction to quantum statistical mechanics and its operator algebraic formulation, modular theory, spectral analysis and their applications to quantum dynamical systems. Volume II is dedicated to the Markovian formalism of classical and quantum open systems. A complete exposition of noise theory, Markov processes and stochastic differential equations, both in the classical and the quantum context, is provided. These mathematical tools are put into perspective with physical motivations and applications. Volume III is devoted to recent developments and applications. The topics discussed include the non-equilibrium properties of open quantum systems, the Fermi Golden Rule and weak coupling limit, quantum irreversibility and decoherence, qualitative behaviour of quantum Markov semigroups and continual quantum measurements.",

Although its roots can be traced back to the 18th century (the Buffon needle problem), the modern theory of random sets was founded by D. Kendall and G. Matheron in the early 1970's. Its rapid development was influenced by applications in Spatial Statistics and by its close connections to Integral Geometry. The volume \"Stochastic Geometry\" contains the lectures given at the CIME summer school in Martina Franca in September 1974. The four main lecturers covered the areas of Spatial Statistics, Random Points, Integral Geometry and Random Sets, they are complemented by two additional contributions on Random Mosaics and Crystallization Processes.

        "abstract": "Combinatorics plays a prominent role in contemporary mathematics, due to the vibrant development it has experienced in the last two decades and its many interactions with other subjects. This book arises from the INdAM conference \"CoMeTA 2013 - Combinatorial Methods in Topology and Algebra,'' which was held in Cortona in September 2013. The event brought together emerging and leading researchers at the crossroads of Combinatorics, Topology and Algebra, with a particular focus on new trends in subjects such as: hyperplane arrangements; discrete geometry and combinatorial topology; polytope theory and triangulations of manifolds; combinatorial algebraic geometry and commutative algebra; algebraic combinatorics; and combinatorial representation theory. The book is divided into two parts. The first expands on the topics discussed at the conference by providing additional background and explanations, while the second presents original contributions on new trends in the topics addressed by the conference",

Hence, BC ventures into material production, contracting, storytelling, knowledge transfer, community organization, which influence their design approach.0By describing the way BC architects & studies design and perform the act of building, the book suggests a trajectory of how BC hopes architecture can contribute to our world in transition.00Exhibition: Belgian Pavilion, 16th Architecture Biennale, Venice, Italy (26.05.-25.11.2018)",

Based on the concept of mimesis, this volume illustrates how forgeries must be understood as autonomous aesthetic practices - creative acts in themselves - rather than as mere rip-offs of an original work of art. The proceedings bring together research from different scholarly fields. They focus on various mimetic practices such as pseudo-translations, imposters, identity theft, and hoaxes in different artistic and historic contexts. By opening up the scope of the aesthetic implications of fakes, this anthology aims to consolidate forging as an autonomous method of creation.",

For astrophysicists, they are important laboratories for the understanding of atomic, molecular, dust, and plasma processes in different cosmic environments; they enable the exploration of the fundamental physics of single and binary star evolution including nucleosynthesis, rotation, mass transfer and loss, and magnetic fields; and they help trace stellar populations, the kinematics, and chemistry of galaxies including our own galaxy, the Milky Way. This volume reviews the current status of this vibrant research field in the form of invited reviews, contributed talks, and posters presented at the IAU Symposium 323.

Due to their large penetration depth, they are ideal for in-situ measurements of samples situated in sophisticated and advanced environments. The advent of new high-intensity neutron sources and instruments, as well as the development of new real-time techniques, allows the tracking of transformation processes in condensed matter on a microscopic scale. The present volume provides a review of the state of the art of this new and exciting field of kinetics with neutrons.",

        "abstract": "This book constitutes the proceedings of the First International ICST Conference, S-CUBE 2009, held in Pisa, Italy, in september 2009. The 16 contributions published in this volume were carefully selected from 45 submitted works in a rigorous peer-reviewed process. In addition to this 3 distinguished researchers were asked to contribute 3 invited papers. The papers examine research challenges facing system development and software support for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Currently, wireless sensor networks introduce innovative and interesting application scenarios that may support a large amount of different applications including environmental monitoring, disaster prevention, building automation, object tracking, nuclear reactor control, fire detection, agriculture, healthcare, and traffic monitoring. The widespread acceptance of these new services can be improved by the definition of frameworks and architectures that have the potential to radically simplify software development for wireless sensor network based applications. The aim of these new architectures is to support flexible, scalable programming of applications based on adaptive middleware. As a consequence, WSNs require novel programming paradigms and technologies. Moreover the design of new complex systems, characterized by the interaction of different and heterogeneous resources, will allow the development of innovative applications that meet high performance goals. Hence, WSNs require contributions from many fields such as embedded systems, distributed systems, data management, system security and applications.",

This conference was organized for the first time in Greenwich, UK, in 2000, and it has been able to attract an increasing number of participants and interest, reflecting the progress made in the field. As in the previous years, EC-Web 2006 served as a forum bringing together researchers from academia and practitioners from industry to discuss the current state of the art in e-commerce and Web technologies. Inspiration and new ideas emerged from intensive discussions that took place during the keynote address, the formal sessions and the social events. The conference attracted 88 paper submissions and each paper was reviewed by three Program Committee members. The Program Committee selected 24 papers for presentation and publication (an acceptance and publication rate of 27%). We have to confess that this task was not that easy due to the high quality of the submitted papers.

            "The near-field earthquake which struck the Hanshin-Awaji area of Japan before dawn on January 17, 1995, in addition to snatching away the lives of more than 6,000 people, inflicted horrendous damage on the region's infrastructure, including the transportation, communication and lifeline supply network and, of course, on buildings, too. A year earlier, the San Fernando Valley area of California had been hit by another near-field quake, the Northridge Earthquake, which dealt a similarly destructive blow to local infrastructures. Following these two disasters, structural engineers and researchers around the world have been working vigorously to develop methods of design for the kind of structure that is capable of withstanding not only the far-field tectonic earthquakes planned for hitherto, but also the full impact of near-field earthquake. Of the observed types of earthquake damage to steel structures, there are some whose causes are well understood, but many others continue to present us with unresolved problems. To overcome these, it is now urgently necessary for specialists to come together and exchange information. The contents of this volume are selected from the Nagoya Colloquium proceedings will become an important part of the world literature on structural stability and ductility, and will prove a driving force in the development of future stability and ductility related research and design"

This process is defined as 'programming' whereby a nutritional stimulus operating at a critical, sensitive period of pre and postnatal life imprints permanent effects on the structure, physiology and metabolism. For this reason, academics and industry set-up the EC supported Scientific Workshop -Early Nutrition and its Later Consequences: New Opportunities. The prime objective of the Workshop was to generate a sound exchange of the latest scientific developments within the field of early nutrition to look for opportunities for new preventive health concepts. Further, a closer look was taken at the development of food applications which could provide (future) mothers and infants with improved nutrition that will ultimately lead to better future health. The Workshop was organised by the Dept. of Pediatrics, University of Munich, Germany in collaboration with the Danone Institutes and the Infant Nutrition Cluster, a collaboration of three large research projects funded by the EU.",

These systems can be roughly described as collections of spatially distributed sensors, actuators and controllers whose behaviour is coordinated through wired or wireless communication links. This integration between different technologies and scientific domains presents new and challenging fundamental problems underlying the theoretical foundations for this class of systems. This workshop aims at bringing together researchers working of different aspects of networked embedded systems in order to exchange research experiences and to identify the main scientific challenges in this exciting new area.",

            "The series of International Conferences on Extending Database Technology (EDBT) is an established and prestigious forum for the exchange of the latest research results in data management. It provides unique opportunities for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore new ideas, techniques, and tools, and to exchange experiences. This volume contains the proceedings of the 10th EDBT Conference, held in Munich, Germany, March 27-29, 2006. The conference included 3 keynote talks, 56 full-size and 4 half-size research papers in 20 sessions, 8 industrial presentations in 3 sessions, 1 panel session, 5 tutorials in 7 sessions, and 20 demonstrations in 4 sessions. All of the research papers as well as papers and abstracts from most of the other sessions are included here. Distinguished members of the database and information-retrieval communities delivered the three keynotes, which were all in the spirit of the banner theme chosen for EDBT 2006: “From Database Systems to Universal Data Management. ” Martin Kersten, a pioneer in the area of database support for ambient application environments and the investigator of several kernel database architectures, discussed various hard issues that arise in organic database systems, i. e. , systems that can be embedded in several hardware applications and have autonomic behavior. Alan Smeaton, a leader in content-based retrieval of information in a wide variety of media, introduced us to the world of digital video libraries and challenged us with several open problems associated with their effective management."

            "This volume of Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series records th the proceedings of the 8 International Workshop on Digital Mammography (IWDM), which was held in Manchester, UK, June 18–21, 2006. The meetings bringtogetheradiversesetofresearchers(physicists,mathematicians,computer scientists, engineers), clinicians (radiologists, surgeons) and representatives of industry, who are jointly committed to developing technology, not just for its ownsake,but to supportclinicians inthe earlydetection andsubsequentpatient management of breast cancer. The conference series was initiated at a 1993 meeting of the SPIE in San Jose, with subsequent meetings hosted every two years by researchers around the world. Previous meetings were held in York, Chicago, Nijmegen, Toronto, Bremen, and North Carolina. It is interesting to re?ect on the changes that have occurred during the past 13 years. Then, the dominant technology was ?lm-screen mammography; now it is full-?eld digital mammography. Then, there were few screening programmes world-wide; now there are many. Then, there was the hope that computer-aided detection (CAD) of early signs of cancer might be possible; now CAD is not only a reality but (more importantly) a commercially led clinical reality. Then, algorithmswerealmostentirelyheuristicwithlittleclinicalsupport;nowthereis arequirementforsubstantialclinicalsupportforanyalgorithmthatisdeveloped and published. However, upon re?ection, could we have predicted with absolute certainty what would be the key questions to be addressed over the subsequent (say) six years? No! That is the nature, joy, and frustration of research. There are more blind alleys to explore than there are rich veins that bring gold (in all senses of that analogy!)."

            "As distinct from other security and cryptography conferences, the Information Security Conference (ISC) 2002 brought together individuals involved in a wide variety of different disciplines of information security to foster the exchange of ideas. The conference is an outgrowth of the Information Security Workshop, first held in Ishikawa, Japan 1997. ISC 2002 was held in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on September 30– October 2, 2002. The Program Committee considered 81 submissions of which 38 papers were accepted for presentation. These proceedings contain revised versions of the accepted papers. The papers provide a representative sample of both the variety and the truly international scope of information security research conducted currently. The topics addressed range from e-commerce protocols to access control and trust management, and to cryptography and cryptographic algorithms. Many people deserve our gratitude for their contribution to the success of the conference. We would like to thank the General Chair, Routo Terada, for overseeing the local arrangements, including registration and maintaining the conference website, and for the smooth running of the conference. We are grateful to Robbie Ye for his expert help in processing the electronic submissions, reviews and acceptance notifications. Robbie’s enthusiasm and energy greatly simplified the Program Committee’s task of conducting the on-line evaluation of the submitted papers under tight time constraints.",

            "Meshfree methods, particle methods, and generalized finite element methods have witnessed substantial development since the mid 1990s. The growing interest in these methods is due in part to the fact that they are extremely flexible numerical tools and can be interpreted in a number of ways. For instance, meshfree methods can be viewed as a natural extension of classical finite element and finite difference methods to scattered node configurations with no fixed connectivity. Furthermore, meshfree methods offer a number of advantageous features which are especially attractive when dealing with multiscale phenomena: a priori knowledge about particular local behavior of the solution can easily be introduced in the meshfree approximation space, and coarse-scale approximations can be seamlessly refined with fine-scale information. This volume collects selected papers presented at the Seventh International Workshop on Meshfree Methods, held in Bonn, Germany in September 2013. They address various aspects of this highly dynamic research field and cover topics from applied mathematics, physics and engineering"

        "abstract": "Traditionally, Lie theory is a tool to build mathematical models for physical systems. Recently, the trend is towards geometrization of the mathematical description of physical systems and objects. A geometric approach to a system yields in general some notion of symmetry which is very helpful in understanding its structure. Geometrization and symmetries are meant in their widest sense, i.e., representation theory, algebraic geometry, infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups, superalgebras and supergroups, groups and quantum groups, noncommutative geometry, symmetries of linear and nonlinear PDE, special functions, and others. Furthermore, the necessary tools from functional analysis and number theory are included. This is a big interdisciplinary and interrelated field. Samples of these fresh trends are presented in this volume, based on contributions from the Workshop \"Lie Theory and Its Applications in Physics\" held near Varna (Bulgaria) in June 2013. This book is suitable for a broad audience of mathematicians, mathematical physicists, and theoretical physicists and researchers in the field of Lie Theory",

            "These lecture notes study the interplay between randomness and geometry of graphs. The first part of the notes reviews several basic geometric concepts, before moving on to examine the manifestation of the underlying geometry in the behavior of random processes, mostly percolation and random walk. The study of the geometry of infinite vertex transitive graphs, and of Cayley graphs in particular, is fairly well developed. One goal of these notes is to point to some random metric spaces modeled by graphs that turn out to be somewhat exotic, that is, they admit a combination of properties not encountered in the vertex transitive world. These include percolation clusters on vertex transitive graphs, critical clusters, local and scaling limits of graphs, long range percolation, CCCP graphs obtained by contracting percolation clusters on graphs, and stationary random graphs, including the uniform infinite planar triangulation (UIPT) and the stochastic hyperbolic planar quadrangulation (SHIQ).",

        "abstract": "Within the subprime crisis (2007) and the recent global financial crisis of 2008-2009, we have observed significant decline, corrections and structural changes in most US and European financial markets. Furthermore, it seems that this crisis has been rapidly transmitted toward the most developed and emerging countries and has strongly affected the whole economy. This volume aims to present recent researches in linear and nonlinear modelling of economic and financial time-series. The several discussions of empirical results of its chapters clearly help to improve the understanding of the financial mechanisms inherent to this crisis. They also yield an important overview on the sources of the financial crisis and its main economic and financial consequences. The book provides the audience a comprehensive understanding of financial and economic dynamics in various aspects using modern financial econometric methods. It addresses the empirical techniques needed by economic agents to analyze the dynamics of these markets and illustrates how they can be applied to the actual data. It also presents and discusses new research findings and their implications.",

The main reason for this ubiquity is the wide and diverse range of applications, such as vehicular traffic, supply chains, blood flow, irrigation channels, data networks and others. This book presents an extensive set of notes by world leaders on the main mathematical techniques used to address such problems, together with investigations into specific applications. The main focus is on partial differential equations in networks, but ordinary differential equations and optimal transport are also included. Moreover, the modeling is completed by analysis, numerics, control and optimization of flows in networks.

            "The term “control theory” refers to the body of results - theoretical, numerical and algorithmic - which have been developed to influence the evolution of the state of a given system in order to meet a prescribed performance criterion. Systems of interest to control theory may be of very different natures. This monograph is concerned with models that can be described by partial differential equations of evolution. It contains five major contributions and is connected to the CIME Course on Control of Partial Differential Equations that took place in Cetraro (CS, Italy), July 19 - 23, 2010. Specifically, it covers the stabilization of evolution equations, control of the Liouville equation, control in fluid mechanics, control and numerics for the wave equation, and Carleman estimates for elliptic and parabolic equations with application to control. We are confident this work will provide an authoritative reference work for all scientists who are interested in this field, representing at the same time a friendly introduction to, and an updated account of, some of the most active trends in current research.",

In a workshop held in Paris, June 2010 several prominent researchers gave exciting talks in honor of his 60th birthday. The present volume includes scientific contributions from this workshop. Probability theory is first and foremost aimed at solving real-life problems containing randomness. Markov processes are one of the key tools for modeling that plays a vital part concerning such problems. Contributions on inventory control, mutation-selection in genetics and public-private partnerships illustrate several applications in this volume. Stochastic differential equations, be they partial or ordinary, also play a key role in stochastic modeling. Two of the contributions analyze examples that share a focus on probabilistic tools, namely stochastic analysis and stochastic calculus. Three other papers are devoted more to the theoretical development of these aspects. The volume addresses graduate students and researchers interested in stochastic analysis and its applications."

        "abstract": "In the recent decade, there has been a growing interest in the numerical treatment of high-dimensional problems. It is well known that classical numerical discretization schemes fail in more than three or four dimensions due to the curse of dimensionality. The technique of sparse grids helps overcome this problem to some extent under suitable regularity assumptions. This discretization approach is obtained from a multi-scale basis by a tensor product construction and subsequent truncation of the resulting multiresolution series expansion. This volume of LNCSE is a collection of the papers from the proceedings of the workshop on sparse grids and its applications held in Bonn in May 2011. The selected articles present recent advances in the mathematical understanding and analysis of sparse grid discretization. Aspects arising from applications are given particular attention.  .",

            "The systematic study of the physical world is largely based on the design of mathematical models using many different types of ordinary differential, partial differential, integral, and integro-differential equations. The solutions of these equations are therefore of great interest to practitioners and to science in general. With a wealth of cutting-edge research in the field, Integral Methods in Science and Engineering: Computational and Analytic Aspects provides a vivid picture of both the development of theoretical integral techniques and their use in specific science and engineering problems. The volume is an outgrowth of talks presented by world-renowned researchers at the Eleventh International Conference on Integral Methods in Science and Engineering held in Brighton, UK, July 12–14, 2010. The array of topics they address is immense, ranging from theoretical advances in boundary integral methods to applications of analytic and numerical quadrature techniques as diverse as integral equations, finite and boundary elements, conservation laws, hybrid approaches, and more. With ample coverage of theory and applications, this book will be a valuable resource for researchers in applied mathematics, physics, and mechanical and electrical engineering, for graduate students in these disciplines, and for various other professionals who use integration as an essential technique in their work."

            "This new volume in the Poincaré Seminar Series, describing recent developments at the interface between physics and biology, is directed towards a broad audience of physicists, biologists, and mathematicians. Both the theoretical and experimental aspects are covered, and particular care is devoted to the pedagogical nature of the presentations. The first survey article, by Jean-Francois Joanny and Jacques Prost, describes the theoretical advances made in the study of \"active gels\", with applications to liquid crystals and cell motility. Jasper van der Gucht and Cécile Sykes then report on recent advances made with biomimetic model systems in the understanding of cytokinesis. The next article, by Jonathon Howard, presents several molecular models for motor proteins, which are compared with experimental results for kinesin. David Lacoste and Kirone Mallick then show theoretically that similar ratchet models of motor proteins naturally satisfy a fundamental time-reversal symmetry, the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation relation. Jean-Francois Allemand, David Bensimon and Vincent Croquette and their coauthors describe the latest advances made in the real-time single molecule study of the enzymes involved in DNA replication. Raymond E. Goldstein addresses the problem of understanding, from a physics perspective, the driving forces behind the biological evolution of multicellularity, using Volvocine algae as model organisms. Stanislas Dehaene finally addresses the major challenge of understanding the neuronal mechanism of consciousness, and speculates on the possible theoretical explanations of MRI experiments.

            "The first of the annual Operator Theory conferences in Ti­ mi~oara held four years ago was a meeting of operator theory spe­ cialists from the National Institute for Scientific and Techni­ cal Creation in Bucharest and from the University of Timi~oara. Since then, the participation to these conferences has greatly increased, by being attended first by operator theorists from allover the country and (since 1978) by an increasing number of foreign mathematicians. Thus the 1980 Conference can be regarded as a truly international Operator Theory meeting, fifteen coun­ tries being represented at it. These conferences are conceived as a means to promote the cooperation between specialists in all areas of Operator Theory. Among the main topics in 1980 were: dilation theory, invariant subspaces, connections with the theory of cX-algebras, subnormal operators, multidimensional functional calculus etc. Though not included in this volume, we would like to mention that in 1980 some special sessions concerning other fields of Functional Ana­ lysis were organized at the Operator Theory conference. The research contracts of the Department of Mathematics of INCREST with the National Council for Sciences and Technoloa,y of Romania provided the means for developping the research activi­ ty in Functional Analysis; these contracts constitute the gene­ rous framework for these meetings.",

Climate change adaptation and mitigation of global warming, generally identified as drivers of global policies, are just the “tip of the iceberg” when it comes to smart energy transition. Indeed, equally relevant towards this current transformation – and key topics in this volume – are ICTs, public spaces and society; next economy for the city; strategies and actions for good governance; urban-rural innovation; rethinking mobility. The book’s depth in understanding and insightfulness in re-thinking demonstrate the breaking of new ground in smart and sustainable planning. A new ground that policy-makers, academics and consultants may build upon as a bedrock for smart and sustainable planning.",

The topics covered range from the extensions of the Lefschetz fixed point and the fixed point index on ANR's, to the theory of parity of one-parameter families of Fredholm operators, and from the theory of coincidence degree for mappings on Banach spaces to homotopy methods for continuation principles.

The exception is an outstanding and lengthy survey paper by Joyal/Street (80 pp) on a growing subject: it gives an account of classical Tannaka duality in such a way as to be accessible to the general mathematical reader, and to provide a key for entry to more recent developments and quantum groups. No expertise in either representation theory or category theory is assumed. Topics such as the Fourier cotransform, Tannaka duality for homogeneous spaces, braided tensor categories, Yang-Baxter operators, Knot invariants and quantum groups are introduced and studies.

        "abstract": "Experts from a range of disciplines explore how humans and artificial agents can quickly learn completely new tasks through natural interactions with each other. Humans are not limited to a fixed set of innate or preprogrammed tasks. We learn quickly through language and other forms of natural interaction, and we improve our performance and teach others what we have learned. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the acquisition of new tasks through natural interaction is an ongoing challenge. Advances in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and robotics are leading us to future systems with human-like capabilities. A huge gap exists, however, between the highly specialized niche capabilities of current machine learning systems and the generality, flexibility, and in situ robustness of human instruction and learning. Drawing on expertise from multiple disciplines, this Strüngmann Forum Report explores how humans and artificial agents can quickly learn completely new tasks through natural interactions with each other. The contributors consider functional knowledge requirements, the ontology of interactive task learning, and the representation of task knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction. They explore natural forms of interactions among humans as well as the use of interaction to teach robots and software agents new tasks in complex, dynamic environments. They discuss research challenges and opportunities, including ethical considerations, and make proposals to further understanding of interactive task learning and create new capabilities in assistive robotics, healthcare, education, training, and gaming.",

            "Digitisation and mechanisation, in conjunction with network phenomena, are fundamentally changing the working and organisational world. They are both a complexity driver and a facilitator. The results of this for the social sector are accordingly multifaceted: new technology-based fields of work are emerging, powerful market players are appearing in changed value creation structures, and both management paradigms and specific requirements for employees and management are changing. Theory and practice are trying to conceptually grasp this new reality from a solution-oriented management perspective: exploration instead of exploitation, disruption instead of evolution or the contradictory concept of organisational ambidexterity. The contributions in this conference volume approach the facets of this complex phenomenon in an interdisciplinary manner, whereby theory and practice can meet on an equal footing, with the result that theoretical and empirical findings alternate with practical tests and findings.

Whilst a growing number of publications deal with the consequences for industrial relations and labour law, social law is still being left out of most research projects on digital work. This book aims at widening the perspective. It concentrates on the two most important questions in the context of social protection in a digitalised world, namely access to social protection systems and their future financing, putting emphasis on platform work. It gives an overview of different national approaches to these questions, it analyses the respective solutions in a comparative manner, and it puts them into a transnational context. By bringing together case studies from Belgium, Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Spain, France and Estonia and addressing the specific reform challenges for EU standard setting, EU coordination and the relation to tax law, the book provides new insights on what a “Social Law 4.0” should look like.",

After a theoretical introduction to the concept of 'elites' in an early Islamic context, the papers focus on elite structures and networks within selected regions of the Empire (Transoxiana, Khurāsān, Armenia, Fārs, Iraq, al-Jazīra, Syria, Egypt, and Ifrīqiya). The papers analyze elite groups across social, religious, geographical, and professional boundaries. Although each region appears unique at first glance, based on their heterogeneous surviving sources, its physical geography, and its indigenous population and elites, the studies show that they shared certain patterns of governance and interaction, and that this was an important factor for the success of the largest empire of Late Antiquity"

        "abstract": "Continuing the theme of the previous volume, these seminar notes reflect general trends in the study of Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis, understood in a broad sense. Two classical topics represented are the Concentration of Measure Phenomenon in the Local Theory of Banach Spaces, which has recently had triumphs in Random Matrix Theory, and the Central Limit Theorem, one of the earliest examples of regularity and order in high dimensions. Central to the text is the study of the Poincaré and log-Sobolev functional inequalities, their reverses, and other inequalities, in which a crucial role is often played by convexity assumptions such as Log-Concavity. The concept and properties of Entropy form an important subject, with Bourgain's slicing problem and its variants drawing much attention. Constructions related to Convexity Theory are proposed and revisited, as well as inequalities that go beyond the Brunn–Minkowski theory. One of the major current research directions addressed is the identification of lower-dimensional structures with remarkable properties in rather arbitrary high-dimensional objects. In addition to functional analytic results, connections to Computer Science and to Differential Geometry are also discussed.",

The architect Eduardo Souto de Moura (b. 1952) has won many accolades, including the 2011 Pritzker Architecture Prize. Based in Porto, Souto de Moura studied under Fernando Tavora and worked under fellow Portuguese architect Alvaro Siza, with whom he continues to collaborate. Souto de Moura established his own practice in 1980, and his wide-ranging influences, including Mies van der Rohe and Donald Judd, can be seen in the stunning variety of his work, from his acclaimed private houses, to the striking Paula Rego Museum in Cascais and the Braga Municipal Stadium, to his work in historical contexts such as the Convento das Bernardas in Tavira. This beautifully illustrated retrospective provides the most comprehensive account of Souto de Moura's career to date. Drawings, notes and sketches from his archive, and newly commissioned photographs complement essays by scholars and prominent architects that trace Souto de Moura's career, contextualize his work within the larger trends of contemporary international architectural culture, and highlight the originality of his design strategy",

        "abstract": "Growth in mammals encompasses several stages, from intrauterine growth through infancy and childhood to adolescence. Each of these phases is characterized by very specific nutritional, molecular and endocrine perspectives which, under ideal conditions, allow the organism to achieve its genetically programmed growth patterns.In this book, an international panel of experts addresses these topics in a historical, physiological and social perspective. The first part investigates the genetic, epigenetic, molecular and nutritional determinants of intrauterine and postnatal growth. Part two deals with non-evolutionary changes which occurred in the recent past, such as changes in body size in utero, during infancy and childhood, and during adolescence, and the potentially unfavorable consequences of enhanced nutrition and growth, including early onset of puberty, development of obesity, and increases in metabolic and cardiovascular disease. The last part addresses the question of which factors define healthy growth in light of the influence of nutritional, molecular and endocrine influences. Although the association between rapid changes in body size and adverse health effects is clear, the precise nature of causality remains uncertain. Presenting the latest scientific findings in growth research, this publication provides essential reading for pediatricians, clinical investigators and health workers",

            "The purpose of the corona workshop was to consider the corona problem in both one and several complex variables, both in the context of function theory and harmonic analysis as well as the context of operator theory and functional analysis. It was held in June 2012 at the Fields Institute in Toronto, and attended by about fifty mathematicians. This volume validates and commemorates the workshop, and records some of the ideas that were developed within. The corona problem dates back to 1941. It has exerted a powerful influence over mathematical analysis for nearly 75 years. There is material to help bring people up to speed in the latest ideas of the subject, as well as historical material to provide background. Particularly noteworthy is a history of the corona problem, authored by the five organizers, that provides a unique glimpse at how the problem and its many different solutions have developed. There has never been a meeting of this kind, and there has never been a volume of this kind. Mathematicians-both veterans and newcomers-will benefit from reading this book. This volume makes a unique contribution to the analysis literature and will be a valuable part of the canon for many years to come",

        "abstract": "The study of materials which exhibit new and unconventional properties is of central importance for the devel- opment of advanced and refined technologies in many fields of engineering science. In this connection there has been a rapidly growing interest in real fluid effects on wave phenomena in the past few years. A prominent example is provided by Bethe-Zel'dovich-Thompson (BZT) fluids which have the distinguishing feature that they exhibit negative nonlinearity over a finite range of temperature and pressures in the pure vapour phase. However, two phase flows with and without phase change are an even richer source of new unexpected and previously thought impossible phenomena. Topics covered by this volume include waves in gases near the critical point, waves in retrograde fluids, temperature waves in superfluid helium and density waves in suspensions of particles in liquids. Clearly, the aim of the various contributions is twofold. First, they are intended to provide scientists and engineers working in these and related areas with an overview of various new physical phenomena as for example expansion shocks, sonic shocks, shock splitting, evaporation and liquafaction shocks and the experimental techniques needed to study these phenomena. Second, an attempt is made to discuss aspects of their mathematical modeling with special emphasis on properties which these phenomena have in common",

The book explores and communicates the laws behind these movements and reports about astonishing similarities and very specific features typical of the given object under considerations. Leading scientists in disciplines as different as archeology, epidemics, linguistics and sociology, in contact with their colleagues from engineering, natural sciences and mathematics, introduce into the phenomena of spreading as relevant for their fields. An introductory chapter on “Spreading Fundamentals” provides a common basis for all these considerations, with a minimum of mathematics, selected and presented for enjoying rather than frustrating the reader."

        "abstract": "Computational Modelling of Concrete and Concrete Structures contains the contributions to the EURO-C 2022 conference (Vienna, Austria, 23-26 May 2022). The papers review and discuss research advancements and assess the applicability and robustness of methods and models for the analysis and design of concrete, fibre-reinforced and prestressed concrete structures, as well as masonry structures. Recent developments include methods of machine learning, novel discretisation methods, probabilistic models, and consideration of a growing number of micro-structural aspects in multi-scale and multi-physics settings. In addition, trends towards the material scale with new fibres and 3D printable concretes, and life-cycle oriented models for ageing and durability of existing and new concrete infrastructure are clearly visible. Overall computational robustness of numerical predictions and mathematical rigour have further increased, accompanied by careful model validation based on respective experimental programmes. The book will serve as an important reference for both academics and professionals, stimulating new research directions in the field of computational modelling of concrete and its application to the analysis of concrete structures. EURO-C 2022 is the eighth edition of the EURO-C conference series after Innsbruck 1994, Bad Gastein 1998, St. Johann im Pongau 2003, Mayrhofen 2006, Schladming 2010, St. Anton am Arlberg 2014, and Bad Hofgastein 2018.

Contributions from different areas of university research examine structures that relate to (partially) autonomous actors (or agents) and the dynamic processes in which they are developed. Processes of knowledge that take place in this context require structures of order that can be experienced interobjectively, and in some cases can also be grasped in symbolism and rituals, even if these structures are created simultaneously with processes of action or knowledge. Recursive references can lead to forms of self-organization. In more highly developed structures, aspects of knowledge, learning (and forgetting) can be included and additionally strengthened or weakened by emotional states.On November 5, 2005, scientists came together for a workshop on \"Formation of Order and Knowledge Processes\" at the University of Hamburg.

            "Over the years, the electric power industry has been using optimization methods to help them solve the unit commitment problem. The result has been savings of tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel costs. Things are changing, however. Optimization technology is improving, and the industry is undergoing radical restructuring. Consequently, the role of commitment models is changing, and the value of the improved solutions that better algorithms might yield is increasing. The dual purpose of this book is to explore the technology and needs of the next generation of computer models for aiding unit commitment decisions. Because of the unit commitment problem's size and complexity and because of the large economic benefits that could result from its improved solution, considerable attention has been devoted to algorithm development in the book. More systematic procedures based on a variety of widely researched algorithms have been proposed and tested. These techniques have included dynamic programming, branch-and-bound mixed integer programming (MIP), linear and network programming approaches, and Benders decomposition methods, among others. Recently, metaheuristic methods have been tested, such as genetic programming and simulated annealing, along with expert systems and neural networks. Because electric markets are changing rapidly, how UC models are solved and what purposes they serve need reconsideration. Hence, the book brings together people who understand the problem and people who know what improvements in algorithms are really possible. The two-fold result in The Next Generation of Electric Power Unit Commitment Models is an assessment of industry needs and new formulations and computational approaches that promise to make unit commitment models more responsive to those needs."

        "abstract": "Klappentext: This book presents a broad overview of the important recent progress which led to the emergence of new ideas in Lipschitz geometry and singularities, and started to build bridges to several major areas of singularity theory. Providing all the necessary background in a series of introductory lectures, it also contains Pham and Teissier's previously unpublished pioneering work on the Lipschitz classification of germs of plane complex algebraic curves. While a real or complex algebraic variety is topologically locally conical, it is in general not metrically conical; there are parts of its link with non-trivial topology which shrink faster than linearly when approaching the special point. The essence of the Lipschitz geometry of singularities is captured by the problem of building classifications of the germs up to local bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism. The Lipschitz geometry of a singular space germ is then its equivalence class in this category. The book is aimed at graduate students and researchers from other fields of geometry who are interested in studying the multiple open questions offered by this new subject.",

The publication presents an overview over the objectives, the organization, the content and the results of the conference. The background for organizing the venue refers to the fact that during the last ten years \"regional governance\" has become a topic of scientific discussion, fueled by the influence of globalization, the EC policies (structural funds, ESDP-process, Committee of the Regions etc.) and regionalization strategies of the member states. In addition, the EC has organized a discourse on \"governance\" in the wake of the \"Nice-process\".  The objectives of the conference were: to get more insights into the present discussion on \"regional governance\", to identify open research questions concerning the general topic, to organize an academic discourse between younger and senior researchers within Europe and to mobilize young researchers of different member states of the EC to form research networks on some of the identified research questions.",

        "abstract": "Rethinking Economics is a major contribution to the reconstruction of an economic theory appropriate to the 21st century. Just as major changes are occurring in the world economy, economics itself is on the brink of change. Orthodox economics is now widely criticized for its sterility and its limited applicability to real-world economic problems. Standard theoretical tools such as general equilibrium theory are now regarded, even by their leading practitioners, as highly limited and problematic. New ideas from chaos theory, evolutionary modelling and institutional theory point to new, non-reductionist approaches in which there are units of analysis other than the atomistic individual. This work addresses core economic concepts, such as individual choice, prices, markets, production, industries, technology, innovation and economic growth in the light of these developments. This unique, up-to-date volume makes a seminal contribution at the frontiers of economic theory",

These are integrated with other functional regions by means of flows of information, knowledge, and commodities. This contemporary and illuminating book provides a state-of-the-art overview of current research on innovation and entrepreneurship in functional regions. There are numerous questions regarding entrepreneurship and innovation in functional regions that have not yet been answered - until now. Some of the issues that the expert contributors in this field question are - How do firms compete and how do they develop their competitive strategies? How important are entrepreneurial actions and innovation? How important are firm size, firm maturity and corporate structure for innovation? Entrepreneurship and Innovations in Functional Regions will be an invaluable resource for students and scholars of entrepreneurship, business economics, innovation and regional science",

This international scientific conference aimed at addressing the current and pot- tial role of satellite remote sensing in climate modeling, with a particular focus on land surface processes and atmospheric aerosol characterization. Global and regional circulation models incorporate our knowledge ofthe dynamics ofthe Earth's atmosphere. They are used to predict the evolution of the weather and climate. Mathematically, this system is represented by a set ofpartial differential equations whose solution requires initial and bo- dary conditions. Limitations in the accuracy and geographical distribution of these constraints, and intrinsic mathematical sensitivity to these conditions do not allow the identification of a unique solution (prediction). Additional observations on the climate system are thus used to constrain the forecasts of the mathematical model to remain close to the observed state ofthe system."

However, the nature of the city, both real and imagined, has always been more permeable than this model reveals. The essays in [this book] respond to this condition by focusing on how social and physical space is conceived as both indefinite and singular. They emphasize the ways this space is shared and thus made into urban culture. Urban Imaginaries offers case studies on cities in Brazil, Israel, Turkey, Lebanon, and India, as well as in the United States and France, and in doing so blends social, cultural, and political approaches to better understand the contemporary urban experience.\"--Publisher description, from p.

        "abstract": "CESifo Seminar Series \"Competitive Failures in Insurance Markets Theory and Policy Implications\" edited by Pierre-André Chiappori and Christian Gollier Risk sharing is a cornerstone of modern economies. It is valuable to risk-averse consumers and essential for investment and entrepreneurs. The standard economic model of risk exchange predicts that competition in insurance markets will result in all individual risks being insured--that all diversifiable risks in the economy will be covered through mutual risk-sharing arrangements--but in practice this is not the case. Many diversifiable risks are still borne by individuals; many environmental, catastrophic, and technological risks are not covered by insurance contracts. In this CESifo volume, leading international economists provide new insights on recent developments in the economic analysis of the limits of insurability. They find that asymmetric information is a central reason why competition in insurance markets may fail to guarantee that mutually advantageous risk exchanges are realized in today's economies. In particular, adverse selection and moral hazard help explain why competitive insurance markets fail to provide an efficient level of insurance and hence why public intervention is required to solve the problem. The contributors offer theoretical models of insurance markets involving adverse selection as well as empirical analyses of health insurance and non-health insurance markets in countries including Australia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States.",

They examine how effective the policies have been in achieving objectives and what policy makers have learned about the design and implementation of their policies. These proceedings show that different methods of policy evaluation are complementary. Most countries focus on evaluating the environmental effectiveness rather than the economic efficiency of policies, using physical indicators rather than monetary values. Many policies are achieving their environmental objectives, but are taking longer than originally anticipated. The initiative being taken in many countries to incorporate monitoring and data collection into program design and implementation is a positive development.  But a number of steps need to be taken to improve the quality of evaluations, including the better articulation of policy goals and objectives, improving data quality and establishing baselines for comparison.--Publisher's summary",

        "abstract": "Statistical learning theory is aimed at analyzing complex data with necessarily approximate models. This book is intended for an audience with a graduate background in probability theory and statistics. It will be useful to any reader wondering why it may be a good idea, to use asis often done in practice a notoriously \"wrong'' (i.e. over-simplified) model to predict, estimate or classify. This point of view takes its roots in three fields: information theory, statistical mechanics, and PAC-Bayesian theorems. Results on the large deviations of trajectories of Markov chains with rare transitions are also included. They are meant to provide a better understanding of stochastic optimization algorithms of common use in computing estimators. The author focuses on non-asymptotic bounds of the statistical risk, allowing one to choose adaptively between rich and structured families of models and corresponding estimators. Two mathematical objects pervade the book: entropy and Gibbs measures. The goal is to show how to turn them into versatile and efficient technical tools,that will stimulate further studies and results.

        "abstract": "The geometry of real submanifolds in complex manifolds and the analysis of their mappings belong to the most advanced streams of contemporary Mathematics. In this area converge the techniques of various and sophisticated mathematical fields such as P.D.E.'s, boundary value problems, induced equations, analytic discs in symplectic spaces, complex dynamics. For the variety of themes and the surprisingly good interplaying of different research tools, these problems attracted the attention of some among the best mathematicians of these latest two decades. They also entered as a refined content of an advanced education. In this sense the five lectures of this volume provide an excellent cultural background while giving very deep insights of current research activity. TOC:Preface.- M.

This Volume is also special by producing papers dedicated to G. Leitmann, one of the founders of the study on dynamics of uncertain systems, and thus emphasising this recently rapidly developing discipline. The three major sets of topics presented deal successively with the general control theory of uncertain systems, with new theoretic methods in control, and with applications to control of robotic manipulators, aircraft control and flexible structures, all well integrated",

        "abstract": "Bring a new level of effectiveness to your software projectsRemember when creating software was fun? It could be again, if you use the methods in this book to help you plan and manage your project. In this new edition of The Software Project Manager's Handbook, expert Dwayne Phillips outlines the fundamental principles that project managers and software practitioners can use to help them succeed on any project. Success on software projects has more to do with how people think individually and in groups than with programming, asserts Phillips. In clear and concise steps, he shows software project managers and their team members how to manage projects effectively by paying attention to four basic principles: . Balancing people, process, and product . Making ideas visible . Applying configuration management properly . Using standards The book describes the requirements, planning, and risk management stages of the development cycle and examines the middle and late stages of development including design, test and integration, and maintenance. Phillips shares proven methods for dealing with common stumbling blocks for managers such as customers who want a voice in the design and endless test-fix cycles, and for planning maintenance so the customer is not left out of the process. Finally, the author examines past projects in detaildemonstrating why some projects were successful and why others failed. Phillips helps you apply these lessons with a \"cookbook\" formula that walks you step-by-step through a Waterfall, an Evolutionary, and a Spiral project.New material added to each chapter covers current issues including the role of process in software projects and the Agile Methods. The Software Project Manager's Handbook, Second Edition is the most innovative and up-to-date guide to making every software project a complete and painless success",

Starting with the Villa Stuck in Munich--the aesthetic, conceptual cosmos and life's work of the aristocratic artist Franz von Stuck--this volume integrates the artist's house as a category into the international context and is the first to assign these buildings the status of major works. About twenty examples bring to life the fascination that these artistic fantasies hold for art lovers, including both existing projects and some which, although they have been lost, were of unique importance in their day and still retain their charisma. Along with paintings, sculptures, and photographs closely related to the houses, plans and models convey the correlation between art and life as well as the kind of harmony of the arts expressed in Richard Wagner's historical concept of the total work of art",

They have shown to be important in several branches of mathematics through their  boundary behaviour, dynamics, membership in different function spaces,  and the asymptotic growth of various integral means of their derivatives. This volume presents a collection of survey and research articles that examine Blaschke products and several of their applications to fields  such as approximation theory, differential equations, dynamical  systems, and harmonic analysis. Additionally, it illustrates the  historical roots of Blaschke products and highlights key research on this topic. The contributions, written by experts from various fields of  mathematical research, include several open problems. They will  engage graduate students and researchers alike, bringing them to the forefront of research in the subject.\"--",

        "abstract": "We are living in the golden era of multiwavelength astronomical observations, probing deep areas of the sky. Sophisticated instruments allow us to compare galaxies at high redshifts, when the Universe was only a few hundred millions years old, with the mature nearby galaxies we see today. This is yielding new insights into the mass assembly and the star formation history of galaxies that may, or may not, be compatible with our current theoretical models. IAU Symposium 277 addresses the major open questions concerning the evolution of galaxies, specifically: can we really apply the knowledge gained from low-redshift studies to the high-redshift galaxy populations, given the strong apparent differences in their observed properties? In this volume theorists and observers attempt to reach a common understanding of the puzzles that galaxy research has recently unfolded, largely through the study of galaxy dynamics and their stellar populations at low and high redshifts. -- Back cover",

Internationally discussions are taking place among government authorities and electric utilities and vendors on how to deal with the rapid technical development and optimisation of nuclear fuel and its utilisation under new, more aggressive fuel management strategies. Improving reactor core monitoring systems is an important part of this process. Participants in a recent NEA workshop discussed how instrumentation, methods and models used in core monitoring can be validated or, if needed, improved and further developed to provide more reliable and detailed information on local power in the core and on other parameters indirectly affecting fuel duty. This book shows how the core monitoring system can be used to support reactor operation in normal and anticipated transient modes and to supply data used to derive initial key core parameters for transient and accident analysis.",

However, its roots lie in the late seventeenth century and the emergence of the Grand Tour and its domestic equivalents in the eighteenth century. Its participants and numerous later travellers and tourists, including geologists and artists, purposefully explored wild landscapes as 'geotourists'. The written and visual records of their observations underpin the majority of papers within this volume; these papers explore some significant geo-historical themes, organizations, individuals and locations across three centuries, opening with seventeenth century elite travellers and closing with modern landscape tourists. Other papers examine the resources available to those geotourists and explore the geotourism paradigm.

In cross-cultural, multi-temporal and interdisciplinary studies the authors examine how things gain meaning and status, generate a multitude of emotions, and feed into the propagation of myths, narratives and discourses. The book is divided according to four themes: soft objects, stoic stories, consuming and the collectable, and waste and technologies. The first section discusses the meanings of the lived environment on the individual and national levels. The second section provides specific examples on the role of things in identity construction. The third section focuses on historical and contemporary aspects of consumption and collecting. The phenomena under scrutiny in the fourth section are moral dilemmas associated with and representations of dirt/waste and advancements in science and technology. Presenting diverse case studies of material culture, the volume points to rich interdisciplinary approaches in cultural theory.",

These nine papers cover three different areas for longitudinal data analysis, four dealing with longitudinal data subject to measurement errors, four on incomplete longitudinal data analysis, and the last one for inferences for longitudinal data subject to outliers. Unlike in the independence setup, the inferences in measurement errors, missing values, and/or outlier models, are not adequately discussed in the longitudinal setup. The papers in the present volume provide details on successes and further challenges in these three areas for longitudinal data analysis. This volume is the first outlet with current research in three important areas in the longitudinal setup. The nine papers presented in three parts clearly reveal the similarities and differences in inference techniques used for three different longitudinal setups. Because the research problems considered in this volume are encountered in many real life studies in biomedical, clinical, epidemiology, socioeconomic, econometrics, and engineering fields, the volume should be useful to the researchers including graduate students in these areas.",

            "Spatial planning has a challenging mandate of design and coordination. Herewith, the tasks of planners and the demands made on planning are becoming increasingly diverse and complex. Planners are thus repeatedly confronted with boundaries and barriers, often reaching the limits of their ability to act. However, such limits are seldom final; they represent rather transitions to new situations. It is a matter of discovering how to overcome the existing boundaries and barriers of (or in) the various dimensions and fields of planning. Often the challenge for planners here is to leave behind what is familiar and to break new ground. This volume seeks answers to the questions of how planning can remain capable of effective action, what would have to change to ensure this, and how planning can perhaps even take advantage of boundaries and barriers. The meeting of the ARL Junges Forum from 29 to 31 Mai 2013 in Kaiserslautern discussed these topics. The focus was on the following questions: How can new avenues be explored in planning? What needs to change, and how can planning actually take advantage of existing boundaries and barriers?",
            "Die Raumplanung hat einen anspruchsvollen Gestaltungs- und Koordinationsauftrag. Dabei werden Aufgaben der Planer und Anforderungen an die Planung zunehmend vielfältiger und komplexer. Planer stoßen folglich in ihrer Arbeit immer wieder auf Hemmnisse und Widerstände und erreichen dabei nicht selten die Grenzen ihrer Handlungsfähigkeit. Grenzen stellen jedoch zumeist keine Endpunkte, sondern Schwellen zu Neuland dar. Es geht darum herauszufinden, wie bestehende Grenzen und Hindernisse (in) der Planung in verschiedenen Dimensionen und Bereichen überwunden werden können. Die Herausforderung für die Planer ist dabei häufig, das Altbekannte zurückzulassen und neue Wege zu beschreiten. Im Band werden Antworten auf die Fragen gesucht, wie die Planung handlungsfähig bleiben kann, was sich gegebenenfalls dafür ändern muss und wie die Planung Grenzen und Hindernisse vielleicht sogar für sich nutzen kann. Die Tagung des Jungen Forums der ARL vom 29. bis 31. Mai 2013 in Kaiserslautern setzte sich mit diesen Themen auseinander. Folgende Fragen standen im Zentrum: Wie können neue Wege in der Planung beschritten werden? Was muss sich ändern, und wie kann Planung die vorhandenen Grenzen und Hindernisse für sich nutzen?"

The contributions present a case for asserting that Indonesian cities were not merely the backdrop to processes of modernization and rising nationalism, but formed a causal factor. Modernization, urbanization, and decolonization were intrinsically linked. The various chapters deal with such innovations as the provision of medical treatments, fresh water and sanitation, the implementation of town planning and housing designs, and policies for coping with increased motorized traffic and industrialization. The contributors share a broad critique of the economic and political dimensions of colonialism, but remain alert to the agency of colonial subjects who respond, often critically, to a European modernity\" --",

        "abstract": "This collection covers a wide range of topics of infinite dimensional dynamical systems generated by parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations, solitary equations, lattice differential equations, delay differential equations, and stochastic differential equations.Infinite dimensional dynamical systems are generated by equations describing the evolution in time of systems whose status must be depicted in infinite dimensional phase spaces. Studying the long-term behaviors of such systems is important in our understanding of their spatiotemporal pattern formation and global continuation, and has been among the major sources of motivation and applications of new developments in nonlinear analysis and other mathematical theories. The theory of infinite dimensional dynamical systems has also increasingly important applications in the physical, chemical and life sciences.This book collects 19 papers from 48 invited lecturers to the International Conference on Infinite Dimensional Dynamical Systems held at York University, Toronto, in September of 2008. As the conference was dedicated to Professor George Sell from University of Minnesota on the occasion of his 70th birthday, this collection reflects his pioneering work and influence in core areas of dynamical systems, including non-autonomous dynamical systems, skew-product flows, invariant manifolds theory, infinite dimensional dynamical systems, approximation dynamics, and fluid flows.",

Stabilization with emphasis on exact controllability: considering a physical system, such as a vibrating plate, one can reach a steady state in a finite time by acting on the boundary. Control of boundaries: given a physical system find the geometry of the domain (optimal shape) which minimizes a cost related to the solution of a boundary value problem in this domain, for example find a minimum drag profile. Many lectures included mathematical analysis as well as engineering applications and numerical simulation",

        "abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing is currently attracting enormous public attention, spurred by the popularity of file-sharing systems such as Napster, Gnutella, and Morpheus. In P2P systems a very large number of autonomous computing nodes, the peers, rely on each other for services. P2P networks are emerging as a new distributed computing paradigm because of their potential to harness the computing power of the hosts composing the network, and because they make their underutilized resources available to each other. This book brings together three especially commissioned invited articles, an introduction, and revised versions of the papers presented at the 1st International Workshop on Agents and Peer-to-Peer Computing, AP2PC 2002, held in Bologna, Italy in July 2002. The book is organized into topical sections on peer-to-peer services, discovery and delivery of trustworthy services, and search and cooperation in peer-to-peer agent systems",

            "This volume is the result of a conference organized with the Oxford Roman Economy Project held at All Souls College at the University of Oxford in June, 2014. The conference aimed to explore the social and environmental context of rivers in the Roman world, especially how Roman activity influenced hydrological activity and how, in turn, hydrological activity influenced Roman life. Specialists in the history, archaeology and environment of the Roman world came together and discussed their research and methods in order to foster discussions about the future direction of interdisciplinary research on ancient rivers. The results of this discussion, presented here, demonstrate a variety of approaches to the study of ancient rivers as well as their historical significance",

            "The analysis of behavioral models is of high importance for cyber-physical systems, as the systems often encompass complex behavior based on e.g. concurrent components with mutual exclusion or probabilistic failures on demand. The rule-based formalism of probabilistic timed graph transformation systems is a suitable choice when the models representing states of the system can be understood as graphs and timed and probabilistic behavior is important. However, model checking PTGTSs is limited to systems with rather small state spaces. We present an approach for the analysis of large scale systems modeled as probabilistic timed graph transformation systems by systematically decomposing their state spaces into manageable fragments. To obtain qualitative and quantitative analysis results for a large scale system, we verify that results obtained for its fragments serve as overapproximations for the corresponding results of the large scale system. Hence, our approach allows for the detection of violations of qualitative and quantitative safety properties for the large scale system under analysis. We consider a running example in which we model shuttles driving on tracks of a large scale topology and for which we verify that shuttles never collide and are unlikely to execute emergency brakes. In our evaluation, we apply an implementation of our approach to the running example.",
            "Die Analyse von Verhaltensmodellen ist für cyber-physikalische Systeme von hoher Bedeutung, da die Systeme häufig komplexes Verhalten umfassen, das z.B. parallele Komponenten mit gegenseitigem Ausschluss oder probabilistischen Fehlern bei Bedarf umfasst. Der regelbasierte Formalismus probabilistischer zeitgesteuerter Graphtransformationssysteme ist eine geeignete Wahl, wenn die Modelle, die Zustände des Systems darstellen, als Graphen verstanden werden können und zeitgesteuertes und probabilistisches Verhalten wichtig ist. Modelchecking von PTGTSs ist jedoch auf Systeme mit relativ kleinen Zustandsräumen beschränkt. Wir präsentieren einen Ansatz zur Analyse von Großsystemen, die als probabilistische zeitgesteuerte Graphtransformationssysteme modelliert wurden, indem ihre Zustandsräume systematisch in überschaubare Fragmente zerlegt werden. Um qualitative und quantitative Analyseergebnisse für ein Großsystem zu erhalten, überprüfen wir, ob die für seine Fragmente erhaltenen Ergebnisse als Überannäherungen für die entsprechenden Ergebnisse des Großsystems dienen. Unser Ansatz ermöglicht es daher, Verstöße gegen qualitative und quantitative Sicherheitseigenschaften für das untersuchte Großsystem zu erkennen. Wir betrachten ein Beispiel, in dem wir Shuttles modellieren, die auf Gleisen einer großen Topologie fahren, und für die wir überprüfen, dass Shuttles niemals kollidieren und wahrscheinlich keine Notbremsungen ausführen. In unserer Auswertung wenden wir eine Implementierung unseres Ansatzes auf das Beispiel an."

            "The formal modeling and analysis is of crucial importance for software development processes following the model based approach. We present the formalism of Interval Probabilistic Timed Graph Transformation Systems (IPTGTSs) as a high-level modeling language. This language supports structure dynamics (based on graph transformation), timed behavior (based on clocks, guards, resets, and invariants as in Timed Automata (TA)), and interval probabilistic behavior (based on Discrete Interval Probability Distributions). That is, for the probabilistic behavior, the modeler using IPTGTSs does not need to provide precise probabilities, which are often impossible to obtain, but rather provides a probability range instead from which a precise probability is chosen nondeterministically. In fact, this feature on capturing probabilistic behavior distinguishes IPTGTSs from Probabilistic Timed Graph Transformation Systems (PTGTSs) presented earlier. Following earlier work on Interval Probabilistic Timed Automata (IPTA) and PTGTSs, we also provide an analysis tool chain for IPTGTSs based on inter-formalism transformations. In particular, we provide in our tool AutoGraph a translation of IPTGTSs to IPTA and rely on a mapping of IPTA to Probabilistic Timed Automata (PTA) to allow for the usage of the Prism model checker. The tool Prism can then be used to analyze the resulting PTA w.r.t. probabilistic real-time queries asking for worst-case and best-case probabilities to reach a certain set of target states in a given amount of time.",
            "Die formale Modellierung und Analyse ist für Softwareentwicklungsprozesse nach dem modellbasierten Ansatz von entscheidender Bedeutung. Wir präsentieren den Formalismus von Interval Probabilistic Timed Graph Transformation Systems (IPTGTS) als Modellierungssprache auf hoher abstrakter Ebene. Diese Sprache unterstützt Strukturdynamik (basierend auf Graphtransformation), zeitgesteuertes Verhalten (basierend auf Clocks, Guards, Resets und Invarianten wie in Timed Automata (TA)) und intervallwahrscheinliches Verhalten (basierend auf diskreten Intervallwahrscheinlichkeitsverteilungen). Das heißt, für das probabilistische Verhalten muss der Modellierer, der IPTGTS verwendet, keine genauen Wahrscheinlichkeiten bereitstellen, die oft nicht zu bestimmen sind, sondern stattdessen einen Wahrscheinlichkeitsbereich bereitstellen, aus dem eine genaue Wahrscheinlichkeit nichtdeterministisch ausgewählt wird. Tatsächlich unterscheidet diese Funktion zur Erfassung des probabilistischen Verhaltens IPTGTS von den zuvor vorgestellten PTGTS (Probabilistic Timed Graph Transformation Systems). Nach früheren Arbeiten zu Intervall Probabilistic Timed Automata (IPTA) und PTGTS bieten wir auch eine Analyse-Toolkette für IPTGTS, die auf Interformalismus-Transformationen basiert. Insbesondere bieten wir in unserem Tool AutoGraph eine Übersetzung von IPTGTSs in IPTA und stützen uns auf eine Zuordnung von IPTA zu probabilistischen zeitgesteuerten Automaten (PTA), um die Verwendung des Prism-Modellprüfers zu ermöglichen. Das Werkzeug Prism kann dann verwendet werden, um den resultierenden PTA bezüglich probabilistische Echtzeitabfragen (in denen nach Worst-Case- und Best-Case-Wahrscheinlichkeiten gefragt wird, um einen bestimmten Satz von Zielzuständen in einem bestimmten Zeitraum zu erreichen) zu analysieren."

        "abstract": "In this paper, we estimate the effects of COVID-19 on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in Germany in 2020 at the sectoral and national level. Counterfactual emissions are estimated based on autoregressive econometric models and distinguish between different factors of emissions based on decomposition analysis. Our findings at the national level suggest that COVID-19 lowered GHG emissions in 2020 in Germany by about 45 Mt CO2-eq (6.1%). Accordingly, about two-thirds of the reduction in emissions between 2019 and 2020 in Germany may be attributed to COVID-19. Our findings at the sectoral level imply that all sectors, with the exception of the transport sector, would have met their emissions target in 2020 without COVID-19. Thus, for the buildings sector and the transport sector, our results suggest policy responses that differ from those pursued by the German government to comply with the provisions of the Federal Climate Change Act.",

Auflage: In this classic analysis and refutation of Eric Williams's 1944 thesis, Seymour Drescher argues that Britain's abolition of the slave trade in 1807 resulted not from the diminishing value of slavery for Great Britain but instead from the British public's mobilization against the slave trade, which forced London to commit what Drescher terms \"econocide.\" This action, he argues, was detrimental to Britain's economic interests at a time when British slavery was actually at the height of its potential. Originally published in 1977, Drescher's work was instrumental in undermining the economic determinist interpretation of abolitionism that had dominated historical discourse for decades following World War II. For this second edition, which includes a foreword by David Brion Davis, Drescher has written a new preface, reflecting on the historiography of the British slave trade since this book's original publication.",

        "abstract": "The unconditional target of Indonesia's NDC foresees a reduction of GHG emissions of 29% relative to a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario, to reach 2034 MtCO2eq in 2030. It further specifies that the energy sector shall take a share of 37.6% of this mitigation effort to reduce emissions by 18.8% relative to BAU, reaching 1355 MtCO2eq emissions in 2030. This study analyses how falling cost projections of renewable energy technologies (solar PV and wind energy) could inform energy sector and climate change mitigation plans of Indonesia.We show that cost projections valid for Indonesia for renewable energies have dramatically fallen over the past years. Costs projected for 2030 a couple of years ago are well undercut by more recent projections for 2030. Recent cost projections for 2030 for wind energy are 31% lower than projections dating from 2015, solar PV cost projections have fallen by 49% on average. If falling costs for renewables are considered, the renewable capacities given in RUEN (the National Energy Master Plan) could be revised at constant investments. The overall renewable energy capacity given in RUEN for 2030 could be increased from 70 GW to 85 GW. Solar PV would become the dominant source of renewable energy, wind energy would slightly surpass geothermal power generation. This increase in renewable capacities could inform the revision of Indonesia's NDC. If falling cost projections of renewables are considered, the unconditional target could be reduced from 2034 MtCO2eq to 2005 MtCO2eq at constant costs. This corresponds an increase from 29% to 30.1% reduction and presents a 9.1% increase in the ambition of the energy sector.",

        "abstract": "Facing climate change, The European Union has set ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. Within Europe, heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) account for a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector and therefore plays a central role in achieving the climate targets. A potential solution to reduce GHG emissions is the use of battery electric vehicles (BEV). However, the limited range of BEV requires a European public fast-charging network to ensure widespread deployment of BEV. Here, European road freight transport flows are modelled based on the publicly available European Transport policy Information System (ETISplus) dataset. The resulting truck flows serve as input for a charging infrastructure network model. Potential charging stations are located using a coverage-oriented approach and sized according to a queuing model such that an average waiting time of five minutes is guaranteed at each location. Our results show that for a share of 15% BEV in HDV stock and a dense network with charging locations every 50 km, a total of 4,067 charging points at 1,640 locations are required by 2030. In contrast, with a share of 5% BEV and charging locations every 100 km, 1,715 charging points are needed at 812 locations. Our findings provide insights for the design of a public fastcharging network in Europe and thus supports the planning of future infrastructure projects.",

This series provides an overview of Schott's activities for scientists, engineers, and managers from all branches of industry worldwide in which glasses and glass ceramics are of interest. Each volume begins with a chapter providing a general idea of the current problems, results, and trends relating to the subjects treated. This new extended edition describes the fundamental principles, the manufacturing process, and applications of low thermal expansion glass ceramics. The composition, structure, and stability of polycrystalline materials with a low thermal expansion are described, and it is shown how low thermal expansion glass ceramics can be manufactured from appropriately chosen glass compositions. Examples illustrate the formation of this type of glass ceramic by utilizing normal production processes together with controlled crystallization. Thus glass ceramics with thermal coefficients of expansion of less than 0.3 x 10(-6)K(-1) can be obtained. Even for the mass production of high-quality cooktop panels (Ceran (R)), oven windows, and other household appliances, a high reproducibility of the properties is achieved. Special glass ceramics (Zerodur (R)) for technological and scientific applications such as high-precision optics or large astronomical mirrors are also discussed. The completely revised edition also features new sections on glass-ceramic applications, with details on their performance, CDC-grinding, and laser gyroscopes containing Zerodur (R).

        "abstract": "The book provides deep insights into the signal extraction problem - especially at the boundary of a sample, where asymmetric filters must be used - and how to solve it optimally. The traditional model-based approach (TRAMO/SEATS or X-12-ARIMA) is an inefficient estimation method because it relies on&nbsp; one-step ahead forecasting performances (of a model) whereas the signal extraction problem implicitly requires good multi-step ahead forecasts also. Unit roots are important properties of the input signal because they generate a set of constraints for the best extraction filter. Since traditional tests essentially rely on one-step ahead forecasting performances, new tests are presented here which implicitly account for multi-step ahead forecasting performances too. The gain in efficiency obtained by the new estimation method is analyzed in great detail, using simulated data as well as 'real world\" time series",

        "abstract": "The \"Engineering Thermofluids\" is a unique textbook, which brings the three pillars of thermal sciences; thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer under one umbrella. These three distinct, yet intertwined subjects are treated in an integrated manner. The primary audiences for this book are senior undergraduate, graduate, and practicing engineers in the fields of aeronautical, chemical industrial, mechanical, and nuclear engineering. Topics are discussed in detail while still using a simple and easy to follow approach. Numerous walk-through examples are solved and illustrations are provided to guide the reader through more subtle topics. Each chapter starts with a section for the introduction of various terminologies used. The chapter on thermodynamics covers the first law, the second law, the power cycles, and the mixture of gases. The chapter on fluid mechanics covers both steady-state and transient single phase-flow as well as two-phase flow. The chapter on heat transfer covers conduction, convection, radiation, boiling, and condensation. These chapters are followed by the chapter on applications of the engineering thermofluid, which covers the design and operations of various heat exchangers, turbomachines, and flowmeters. Many practical design problems are either solved or provided as homework. Practicing engineers will find this book a useful text to have around for the many practical problems and solutions, illustrations, definitions, methods, tables, and figures provided. The preference throughout the text is on obtaining analytical solutions of a closed form. Numerical solutions as well as experimental results are presented when analytical solutions cannot be found",

        "abstract": "Container transportation is the predominant mode of inter-continental cargo traffic. Since container ships and port terminals involve a huge capital investment and significant daily operating costs, it is of crucial importance to efficiently utilize the internal resources of container terminals and transportation systems. Today there is an ongoing trend to use automated container handling and transportation technology, in particular, in countries with high labour costs. This in turn requires highly sophisticated control strategies in order to meet the desired performance measures. The primary objective of this book is to reflect these recent developments and to present new insights and successful solutions to operational problems of automated container terminals and transportation systems. It comprises reports on the state of the art, applications of quantitative methods, as well as case studies and simulation results. Its contributions are written by leading experts from academia and business. The book addresses practitioners as well as academic researchers in logistics, transportation, and management.

        "abstract": "David Bornstein`s How to Change the World is the first book to study a remarkable and growing group of individuals around the world--what Bornstein calls social entrepreneurs. These men and women are bringing innovative, and successful, grass-roots approaches to a wide variety of social and economic problems, from rural poverty in India to discrimination against gypsies in Central Europe; from industrial pollution in the United States to child prostitution in Thailand. Like business entrepreneurs, social entrepreneurs are creative, driven, and adventurous. The embrace change, exploit new opportunities, and think big. In How to Change the World, Bornstein provides vivid profiles of many such individuals, looking at the personalities, strategies, and techniques they have in common. The book is an In Search of Excellence for social initiatives, intertwining personal stories, anecdotes, and analysis. Readers will see how social entrepreneurs bring about structural changes in their societies--in other words, how one human being can make a difference.The case studies in the book include Jody Williams, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the international campaign against landmines she ran by e-mail from her Vermont home; Roberto Baggio, a 31-year old Brazilian who has established eighty computer schools in the slums of Brazil; and Diana Propper, who has used investment banking techniques to make American corporations responsive to environmental dangers. The paperback edition will offer a new foreword by the author that shows how the concept of social entrepreneurship has expanded and unfolded over the last few years, including the Gates-Buffetts charitable partnership, the rise of Google, and the increased mainstream coverage of the subject. The book will also update the stories of individual social entrepreneurs that appeared in the cloth edition.",

The classical treatment is mathematically rigorous with a generally theoretical layout, though indications to some of the physical origins of pdes are made throughout in references to potential theory, similarity solutions for the porous medium equation, generalized Riemann problems, and others. The material begins with a focus on the Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem, discussing the notion of characteristic surfaces to classify pdes. Next, the Laplace equation and connected elliptic theory are treated, as well as integral equations and solutions to eigenvalue problems. The heat equation and related parabolic theory are then presented, followed by the wave equation in its basic aspects. An introduction to conservation laws, the uniqueness theorem, viscosity solutions, ill-posed problems, and nonlinear equations of first order round out the key subject matter. Large parts of this revised second edition have been streamlined and rewritten to incorporate years of classroom feedback, correct errors, and improve clarity. Most of the necessary background material has been incorporated into the complements and certain nonessential topics have been given reduced attention (noticeably, numerical methods) to improve the flow of presentation. The exposition is replete with examples, problems and solutions that complement the material to enhance understanding and solidify comprehension. The only prerequisites are advanced differential calculus and some basic Lp theory. The work can serve as a text for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, physics, engineering, and the natural sciences, as well as an excellent reference for applied mathematicians and mathematical physicists.\"--Publisher's description",

        "abstract": "In November 2005, New Orleans city leaders asked RAND to estimate the repopulation of the city in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The Bring New Orleans Back Commission needed estimates of the cityb2ss population in the immediate future (the next three to six months) and the near-term future (the next one to three years) to guide the redevelopment planning process. The study was completed in early January 2006. A conceptual framework based on the costs and benefits of migration and on the role of social networks and physical constraints guided the estimates. Housing habitability was determined to be the key driver of the future population of New Orleans. RAND developed an approach to estimating future population for four points in time based on estimates of housing habitability, which were, in turn, determined by floodwater depth and the pace of housing reconstruction, as well as an estimate of the pre-Katrina population by the condition of its housing after Katrina. An important role for policymakers in shaping the repopulation process in New Orleans will be to minimize the uncertainty faced by residents and businesses by speeding up the reconstruction process",

It is a book that will be used both as a textbook and as a reference and guide to engineers, operation researchers, applied mathematicians and social scientists whose work involves the theoretical aspects of dynamic optimization and differential games. Included throughout the text are detailed explanations of several original dynamic and game-theoretic mathematical models, which are of particular relevance in today's technologically-driven-global economy: revenue management, supply chain management, electric power systems, urban freight systems, dynamic congestion pricing, dynamic traffic assignment, electronic commerce and the Internet. In addition, there will be some more traditional applications with useful pedagogical content included in Chapter 1. The book combines an emphasis on deterministic models and methods along with an introduction to stochastic optimal control and stochastic differential games. And most important, the book covers both theory and applications. It develops the key results of deterministic, continuous time, optimal control theory from both the classical calculus of variations perspectives and the more modern approach of infinite dimensional mathematical programming. Infinite dimensional mathematical programming provides greater utility for solving continuous-time-differential-game problems",

This technique is presently the most widely used numerical method in kinetic theory. We consider three modifications of the DSMC method and study them with respect to their efficiency and convergence properties. Convergence is investigated both with respect to the number of particles and to the time step. The main issue of interest is the time step discretization error due to various splitting strategies. A scheme based on the Strang-splitting strategy is shown to be of second order with respect to time step, while there is only first order for the commonly used Euler-splitting scheme. On the other hand, a no-splitting scheme based on appropriate Markov jump processes does not produce any time step error. It is established in numerical examples that the no-splitting scheme is about two orders of magnitude more efficient than the Euler-splitting scheme. The Strang-splitting scheme reaches almost the same level of efficiency compared to the no-splitting scheme, since the deterministic time step error vanishes sufficiently fast.",

The corresponding energy favors the liquid substrate to be only partially covered by the upper liquid. This is expressed by a negative spreading coefficient which arises from an intermolecular potential combining attractive and repulsive forces and leads to an ultra-thin layer of thickness e. For the corresponding lubrication models existence of stationary solutions is proven. In the limit e to 0 matched asymptotic analysis is applied to derive sharp-interface models and the corresponding contact angles, i.e. the Neumann triangle. In addition we use G-convergence and derive the equivalent sharp-interface models rigorously in this limit. For the resulting model existence and uniqueness of energetic minimizers are proven.

        "abstract": "There are two common approaches to implement a virtual machine (VM) for a dynamic object-oriented language. On the one hand, it can be implemented in a C-like language for best performance and maximum control over the resulting executable. On the other hand, it can be implemented in a language such as Java that allows for higher-level abstractions. These abstractions, such as proper object-oriented modularization, automatic memory management, or interfaces, are missing in C-like languages but they can simplify the implementation of prevalent but complex concepts in VMs, such as garbage collectors (GCs) or just-in-time compilers (JITs). Yet, the implementation of a dynamic object-oriented language in Java eventually results in two VMs on top of each other (double stack), which impedes performance. For statically typed languages, the Maxine VM solves this problem; it is written in Java but can be executed without a Java virtual machine (JVM). However, it is currently not possible to execute dynamic object-oriented languages in Maxine. This work presents an approach to bringing object models and execution models of dynamic object-oriented languages to the Maxine VM and the application of this approach to Squeak/Smalltalk. The representation of objects in and the execution of dynamic object-oriented languages pose certain challenges to the Maxine VM that lacks certain variation points necessary to enable an effortless and straightforward implementation of dynamic object-oriented languages' execution models. The implementation of Squeak/Smalltalk in Maxine as a feasibility study is to unveil such missing variation points.",

We continue to receive positive feedback from old users, and each year hundreds of engineers, quality specialists, and statisticians discover the book for the first time and become new fans. So why a 3rd edition? There are always new methods and techniques that update and improve upon older methods, but that was not the primary reason we felt the need to write a new edition. In the last 15 years, the ready availability of relatively inexpensive, powerful, statistical software has changed the way statisticians and engineers look at and analyze all kinds of data. Problems in reliability that were once difficult and time consuming for even experts now can be solved with a few well-chosen clicks of a mouse. Additionally, with the quantitative solution often comes a plethora of graphics that aid in understanding and presenting the results. All this power comes with a price, however. Software documentation has had difficulty keeping up with the enhanced functionality added to new releases, especially in specialized areas such as reliability analysis. Also, in some cases different well-known software packages use different methods and output different answers. An analyst needs to know how to use these programs effectively and which methods are the most highly recommended. This information is hard to find for industrial reliability problems\"--",

However, there is currently a lack of detailed reports about how different MDE techniques are integrated into the development and combined with each other. To learn more about such MDE settings, we performed a descriptive and exploratory field study with SAP, which is a worldwide operating company with around 50.000 employees and builds enterprise software applications. This technical report describes insights we got during this study. For example, we identified that MDE settings are subject to evolution. Finally, this report outlines directions for future research to provide practical advises for the application of MDE settings.",

            "\"Preface The authors would like to acknowledge the almost 40 years of dedicated work by Professor Willis F. Long of the Department of Engineering Professional Development at the University of Wisconsin--Madison that has made this book possible. It was because of his efforts that the first course of a series, Power Cable Engineering Clinic, was presented in the early 1970s where Dr. Eugene Greenfield gave all the lectures for 8 hours a day during the 5 days of the course. He later added a few lecturers to share the work load. The course was reorganized in 1999 and called \"How to Design, Install, Operate, and Maintain Reliable Power Cable Systems\" and divided into two sessions: \"Understanding Power Cable Characteristics and Applications\" and \"Assessing and Extending the Life of Shielded Power Cable Systems.\" The present course is known as \"Understanding Power Cable Characteristics and Applications.\" Over the years, numerous lecturers have produced copious class notes that form the basis for much of the material that has been rearranged into a book format. The contributors hope that their team effort will be a useful addition to the library of all dedicated cable engineers. The dynamics of the cable industry produces many new materials, products, and concepts, which are incorporated into new editions. New chapters have been prepared (Low Voltage Cables and Thermal Resistivity of Soils) while others have been updated and expanded (Conductors now includes metric designations and Acronyms have been added to the Glossary) for this Third Edition. Emphasis of this book remains on low and medium voltages since they comprise the majority of cables in service throughout the world\"--",
            "\"Fully updated, this third edition addresses the design, application, and preparation of terminating and splicing cables. The book provides methods for testing shielded power cable systems in the field, and it shows how conductor material, size, and design depend on ampacity, voltage regulation, and other factors. It also covers the up-to-date methods of design, manufacture, installation, and operation of power cables. Written for professionals as well as students, this book emphasizes low and medium voltages because they comprise the quantity of cable in service throughout the world. This reference includes an extensive glossary, as well as key references, tables, equations, and photographs\"--"

There has been much consolidation and retrenchment in the nuclear industry since the 1980s, with the emergence of some large global nuclear companies.

        "abstract": "Hydroinformatics has emerged over the last decade to become a recognised andestablished field of independent research activities within the hydrological and environmentalscience communities. Hydroinformatics is not just an application of Informationand Communications Technologies (ICT) to water resources, hydraulics,hydrology or environment. It strives to provide an amalgamation of water sciencewith modern technologies for the purposes of satisfying social requirements. TheEuropean Geosciences Union (EGU) held its first dedicated session on Hydroinformaticsin 2005 at the Vienna Meeting; that same meeting voted to establish theHydroinformatics Sub-Division and Technical Committee (part of the HydrologicalSciences Division). The aim of that original session was to provide an active forumin which to demonstrate and discuss the integration and appropriate application ofemergent computational technologies in a water modelling context. The initial proposalfor this book arose at that meeting out of a desire to collect together a range ofdifferent contributions from academics and practitioners working in various sectorsacross the field; there were no other published compendiums at that point which attemptedto span the latest set of methods or topics of hydrological interest that werepresented at our meeting. The starting point for the selection of authors was thesession itself. Further contributors were invited to submit papers in order to bolsterparticular sections and provide a representative selection of research across the mainthematic areas: neural networks, fuzzy logic, global and evolutionary optimisation,emerging technologies and model integration.This book is aimed at hydrologists, scientists, students and practitioners interestedin a set of techniques derived largely from artificial and computational intelligenceto solve a range of problems in hydrology. We hope that this book will promotethe field of Hydroinformatics and bridge the gap between theory and practice.We would like to thank the chapter authors for their interesting contributionsand the many reviewers who have helped to make this a useful and high-qualitypublication.

The maleimide compounds show no fluorescence, but after conjugated addition fluorescence turns on. This process was explained by calculations of the theoretical chemistry.

        "abstract": "The dissertation covers the topic of structural robustness of metabolic networks on the basis of the concept of elementary flux modes (EFMs). It is shown that the number of EFMs does not reflect the topology of a network sufficiently. Thus, new methods are developed to determine the structural robustness of metabolic networks. These methods are based on systematic in-silico knockouts and the subsequent calculation of dropped out EFMs. Thereby, together with single knockouts also double and multiple knockouts can be used. After evaluation of these methods they are applied to metabolic networks of human erythrocyte and hepatocyte as well as to a metabolic network of Escherichia coli (E. coli). It is found that the erythrocyte has the lowest structural robustness, followed by the hepatocyte and E. coli. These results coincide very well with the circumstance that human erythrocyte and hepatocyte and E. coli are able to adapt to conditions with increasing diversity. In a further part of the dissertation the concept of EFMs is expanded to signal transduction pathways consisting of kinase cascades. The concept of EFMs is based on the steady-state condition for metabolic pathways. It is shown that under certain circumstances this steady-state condition also holds for signalling cascades. Furthermore, it is shown that it is possible to deduce minimal conditions for signal transduction without knowledge about the kinetics involved. On the basis of these assumptions it is possible to calculate EFMs for signalling cascades. But due to the fact that these EFMs do no longer just have mass flux but also information flux, they are now called elementary signalling modes (ESMs).",

        "abstract": "\"This book provides an example of a thorough statistical treatment in space and time of ocean wave data. It is demonstrated how the flexible framework of Bayesian hierarchical space-time models can be applied to oceanographic processes such as significant wave height in order to describe dependence structures and uncertainties in the data. This monograph is a research book and it is in some sense cross-disciplinary. The methodology itself is firmly rooted in the statistical research tradition, based on probability theory and stochastic processes. However, the methodology has been applied to a problem within physical oceanography, analysing data for significant wave height, which are of crucial importance to ocean engineering disciplines. Indeed, the statistical properties of significant wave height are important for the design, construction and operation of ships and other marine and coastal structures. Furthermore, the book addresses the question of whether climate change has an effect of the ocean wave climate, and if so what these effects might be. Thus, this book is an important contribution to the on-going debate on climate change, its implications and how to adapt to a changing climate, with a particular focus on the maritime industries and the marine environment. This book should be of general interest to anyone with an interest in statistical modelling of environmental processes, and in particular to those with a particular interest in the ocean wave climate. It is written on a level that should be understandable to everyone with a basic background in statistics or elementary mathematics, and an introduction to some basic concepts is given in appendices for the uninitiated reader. The intended readership includes students and professionals involved in statistics, oceanography, ocean engineering, environmental research, climate sciences and risk assessment. Moreover, different stakeholders within the maritime industries such as design offices, classification societies, ship owners, yards and operators, flag states and intergovernmental agencies such as the IMO might find the results relevant\"--",

            "In this thesis, auditory models were applied to rehabilitative hearing devices in order to predict their expected benefit for the user. Rehabilitative hearing devices under test were (i) three different single-microphone noise reduction algorithms and (ii) a simulated cochlear implant. The first benefit was defined as the Acceptable Noise Level with a noise reduction algorithm in comparison to the situation without an algorithm. The influence of noise reduction algorithms on the Acceptable Noise Level could partly be predicted with the Oldenburg Perception Model for the averaged data from measurements with subjects. The second benefit was defined as the restored speech recognition performance for the Oldenburg sentence test with cochlear implants in dependence on pathologic peripheral changes of the auditory system as well as on different cognitive performance for the speech perception. From the model simulations with the cochlear implant model it was concluded that an individual prediction of the speech recognition performance might be possible with a precise estimation of the number and density of surviving auditory nerve cells together with the spatial spread function of the electric field as well as the cognitive speech recognition. <engl.>",

            "Triple helix-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) are one of the most specific DNA duplex binding agents and offer new perspectives towards oligonucleotide-mediated gene regulation and manipulation. However, the poor thermodynamic stability of DNA triplexes under physiological conditions limits a successful application in the antigene strategy. Thus, the conjugation of TFOs with small triplex-specific binding ligands is a promising approach to stabilize the formed complexes and to enhance their overall binding affinity. The present study focused on the synthesis of novel TFO conjugates with triplex-binding indolo[3,2-b]quinoline derivatives (PIQ) and on their ability to form and stabilize intermolecular triplexes through their recognition of a duplex target. During the course of the work the thermodynamics of conjugate binding and structural aspects of drug-DNA interactions have been characterized by a variety of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques.",

            "Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci) are human pathogens, which are able to pass the host nasopharyngeal barriers and cause severe diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis and septicemia. As pneumococci are members of the order of lactobacillales, the major catabolite of carbohydrate metabolism under aerobe and microaerophilic atmosphere is lactate. However S. pneumoniae synthesizes also a large fraction of ABC transporter systems involved in uptake and metabolism of carbohydrates, soluble compounds and amino acids. Here we started to analyze carbon metabolism by 13C isotopologue perturbation after growth of pneumococci in chemically defined media (CDM) in the presence of [U-13C6]glucose or [1,2-13C2]glucose as the sole C-source. GC/MS analysis showed a pattern of labeled and non labeled amino acids. The results suggest that pneumococci take up specific amino acids, while others are synthesized de novo by classical or non-classical biosynthesis pathways. His, Glu, Ile, Leu, Val, Pro and Gly remain unlabeled, which is a hint for the lack of de novo synthesis pathways or their regulation under certain environmental conditions. Strikingly, the data for the essential branched amino acids (BAA; Ile, Leu and Val) are unexpected, as genes encoding enzymes required for the synthesis were annotated (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).

            "The importance of learning outcomes in higher education is constantly increasing. But at Germany’s higher educational institutions, there still is a remarkable lack of proper implementation concerning the “Shift from Teaching to Learning”. The dissertation analyses the term and concept of learning outcomes within politics of higher education. It points out how the constructions of employability and citizenship are linked to learning outcomes. It is also being analysed how instructional design in higher education can be further developed in connection to the aspect of learning outcomes. Likewise, it has been achieved to point out systematically the discussion about learning outcomes from a higher education policy perspective as well as from an instructional design perspective. At last, the dissertation explores the perspective of practicians concerning their view on coherent, outcome-oriented higher education. This exploration will lead to lines of development as well as to practical recommendations for outcome-oriented higher education. In addition, this should pave the way for quality development at German HEIs under the aspect of learning outcomes. <engl.>",

            "Against the background of post-socialist transition and nationwide economic growth in Azerbaijan this dissertation analyses the utilisation of rangeland resources by mobile pastoralists in Azerbaijan. The study was motivated by the initially scarce knowledge about pastoralism in Azerbaijan and concerns about declining pasture condition due to growing livestock numbers. The study was guided by three research objectives, which were addressed cumulatively in five publications. The first objective aims at analysing the development of pastoralism in the transition period in comparison to developments in the pastoral sectors of other post-socialist countries. Secondly, the study addresses socio-economic causes of inappropriate pasture management by pastoralists. Finally, in an application-oriented research process recommendations for improving the management of pastoral farms and pasture governance were developed in order to mitigate inappropriate pasture management. For addressing these objectives the study frames the management of rangelands as a complex natural resource management system, in which the environment, users, governance structures, and the socio-political context are closely linked. Within this framework, the study focused especially on pastoral farms using a farm economics approach and on pasture governance with employing institutional economic theories. Regarding the methodology, a case study approach in four study regions was chosen in order to deal with the ..."

Such systems find application in rather remote outdoor areas (e.g. in forests) or indoors. In both application scenarios, the available illumination densities are two to three orders of magnitude below the given illumination densities in standard photovoltaic applications. Therefore, the solar cell behavior under low illumination densities (0.1 mW/cm² to 10 mW/cm²) and underartificial light sources is of importance for the application of solar cells in energy harvesting systems. Within this work, the current state of the art for solar cells in indoorand low light applications is presented with the focus on solar cell characterization and optimization. This work offers new findings and approaches in both fields.For the characterization of solar cells under low illumination densities and underartificial light sources, three different characterization methods or approaches are presented in this work",

            "Zusammenfassung: This thesis considers so-called qualitative constraint-based reasoning: qualitative information is formalized and posed as constraints to entities. Algorithms process these constraints to decide the satisfiability of the description. This approach has often been formalized by means of relation algebras, which has led to the definition of qualitative constraint calculi. In contrast, I consider the reasoning problem in the context of constraint programming. To this end, I compare the relation-algebraic approach to established alternative formalisms, such as constraint languages and first-order logic. The results illustrate shortcomings in previous work and show that a more flexible approach by means of constraint languages can be used to substitute the relation-algebraic view. Further, previously used \"qualitative techniques\" are compared with established generic algorithms from constraint programming. This results in an implementation of a solver, called GQR, which combines techniques from both sides to provide improved qualitative constraint-based reasoning.To further illustrate the difference between qualitative constraint calculi and constraint programming, I formulate several popular examples of such calculi - the Point and Interval Algebra, as well as RCC8 -  in the form of improved representations with dedicated sets of logic rules. The relation-algebraic approach can also be understood in this way, such that a comparison is possible. Both theoretical study and empirical evaluation show that efficient approaches are in particular those representations with sets of rule that are capable of solving large fragments of the language in polynomial time. Moreover, this research shows properties of previous approaches by means of propositional satisfiability.Next, qualitative spatio-temporal constraint problems are studied. As these have been solved with constraint programming before, I theoretically formulate the problem for the Point Algebra. An analysis shows that most fragments of the spatio-temporal language have an associated NP-complete satisfiability problem - despite the fact that constraint problems of the simple Point Algebra are polynomial time. I also briefly present an application of this formalism to robot motion planning.Finally, I consider reasoning problems in the context of qualitative route descriptions. The main focus here is to derive computational complexity results for generating and evaluating such descriptions on a g ...",
            "Zusammenfassung: Die vorliegende Arbeit behandelt das sogenannte qualitative Schließen mittels Constraint-basierten Methoden. Dabei werden qualitative Informationen in Form von Einschränkungen (Constraints) an Objekte formuliert und durch Algorithmen untereinander in Bezug gesetzt um Aussagen über die Realisierbarkeit der Beschreibung zu erhalten. Klassischerweise wurden solche Ansätze oft auf der Basis von Relationenalgebren formalisiert. Diese Problemauffassung bildet insbesondere die Grundlage für die oft zitiert und verwendete Definition von qualitativen Constraint-Kalkülen.Diese Dissertation stützt sich größtenteils auf den Ansatz der Constraintprogrammierung, in der verschiedene Arten von Constraints miteinander verbunden und durch spezifische oder generische Algorithmen verarbeitetet werden. Dabei tritt inbesondere der eigentliche relationenalgebraische Ansatz in den Hintergrund, da die Art der Constraints und deren Verarbeitung deutlich freier gewählt werden kann. Zu diesem Zweck wird hier ein Vergleich des relationenalgebraischen Ansatzes zu den alternativen Formalismen, Constraint-Sprachen und Prädikatenlogik erster Stufe, gezogen. Dieser Vergleich liefert auch direkt die Erkenntnisse, dass ein sehr ähnlicher, aber deutlich generellerer, Ansatz auch mittels Constraint-Sprachen möglich ist und eine frühere Aussage über Eigenschaften qualitativer Constraint-Kalküle fehlerhaft ist. Nachfolgend werden dann die Algorithmen aus der Literatur über solche Kalküle den generischen Algorithmen der Constraintprogrammierung gegenübergestellt. Auch dieser Vergleich führt zu dem Schluss, dass die Constraintprogrammierung sehr geeignet ist um diese Art des qualitativen Schließens darzustellen und zu verarbeiten, wenngleich vereinzelte \"qualitative Techniken\" nicht unmittelbar als generische Algorithmen in der Constraintprogrammierung zu finden sind. Eine Implementation, die Techniken beider Seiten vereint, stellt das von mir mitentwickelte Programm GQR da, welches Probleminstanzen der qualitativen Constraint-Kalküle effizient löst.Um weiter den Unterschied zwischen dem Ansatz mittels Relationenalgebren und Constraintprogrammierung zu verdeutlichen, werden hier bekannte Beispiele qualitativer Constraint Kalküle - die Punkt- und Intervall-Algebra, sowie RCC8 - verbessert modelliert und für diese effiziente Schlussregeln entwickelt.

        "abstract": "Injection of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) is an innovative technology for in situ installation of a permeable reactive barrier in the subsurface. Zerovalent iron (ZVI) is highly reactive with chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs) and renders them into less harmful substances. Application of nZVI instead of granular ZVI can increase rates of dechlorination of CHCs by orders of magnitude, due to its higher surface area. This approach is still difficult to apply due to fast agglomeration and sedimentation of colloidal suspensions of nZVI, which leads to very short transport distances. To overcome this issue of limited mobility, polyanionic stabilisers are added to increase surface charge and stability of suspensions. In field experiments maximum transport distances of a few metres were achieved. A new approach, which is investigated in this thesis, is enhanced mobility of nZVI by a more mobile carrier colloid. The investigated composite material consists of activated carbon, which is loaded with nZVI. In this cumulative thesis, transport characteristics of carbon-colloid supported nZVI (c-nZVI) are investigated. Investigations started with column experiments in 40 cm columns filled with various porous media to investigate on physicochemical influences on transport characteristics. The experimental setup was enlarged to a transport experiment in a 1.2-m-sized two-dimensional aquifer tank experiment, which was filled with granular porous media. Further, a field experiment was performed in a natural aquifer system with a targeted transport distance of 5.3 m. Parallel to these investigations, alternative methods for transport observations were investigated by using noninvasive tomographic methods. Experiments using synchrotron radiation and magnetic resonance (MRI) were performed to investigate in situ transport characteristics in a non-destructive way. Results from column experiments show potentially high mobility under environmental relevant conditions. Addition of mono-and bivalent salts, e.g. more than 0.5 mM/L CaCl2, might decrease mobility. Changes in pH to values below 6 can inhibit mobility at all. Measurements of colloid size show changes in the mean particle size by a factor of ten. Measurements of zeta potential revealed an increase of –62 mV to –82 mV. Results from the 2D-aquifer test system suggest strong particle deposition in the first centimetres and only weak straining in the further travel path and no gravitational influence on particle transport. Straining at the beginning of the travel path in the porous medium was observed with tomographic investigations of transport. MRI experiments revealed similar results to the previous experiments, and observations using synchrotron radiation suggest straining of colloids at pore throats. The potential for high transport distances, which was suggested from laboratory experiments, was confirmed in the field experiment, where the transport distance of 5.3 m was reached by at least 10% of injected nZVI. Altogether, transport distances of the investigated carbon-colloid supported nZVI are higher than published results of traditional nZVI",

        "abstract": "Scanning Near-field Optical Microscopy (SNOM) is a powerful and widely-used method in nano- and micro-optics. In aperture SNOM, a dielectric tip with an opaque coating featuring a sub-wavelength aperture at the tip apex is used either to locally illuminate the sample under investigation, or to map the sample’s optical near-fields. In contrast to classical microscopy, SNOM provides access to the evanescent fields at the sample surface and is thus able to break the diffraction limit. In this thesis, several new near-field characterization methods were developed: By combining two SNOMs with fiber tips into a Dual-SNOM setup, samples can be near-field illuminated at a freely chosen position by the first tip, while the second tip scans the sample surface and maps the optical near-fields, thus giving access to the near-field Green’s function. The Dual-SNOM was used for polarization-selective mapping of plasmonic aperture emission and for the investigation of plasmonic modes in metal strip waveguides. Furthermore, two single-tip techniques were developed and were applied to map whispering-gallery modes (WGM) in fused silica microdisk resonators. In scanning thermocouple-probe microscopy, the sample surface is scanned by a miniature thermocouple tip, which is heated by optical absorption and thus converts the optical signal into an electrical signal directly at the measurement location. In the second mapping method for WGM, a sharp, fully metal-coated fiber tip is used as a scatterer whose position influences the resonance positions and the coupling between WGMs and their respective counter-propagating, degenerate modes. Consequently, the transmission and reflection that can be measured at the ends of the tapered fiber loop which serves for excitation of the WGMs are also modified by the tip’s presence. By correlating the transmission and reflection signals with the tip’s position, highly resolved images were obtained. As an application example of aperture SNOM, near-field mapping of non-broadening plasmonic Airy beams and of plasmonic hot-spots generated by interference of two such beams is demonstrated.",

The main objective of this thesis is to address these shortcomings and to better understand and compare the hydrological and erosional process responses to such natural and man-made disturbances.

        "abstract": "Even though quite different in occurrence and consequences, from a modeling perspective many natural hazards share similar properties and challenges. Their complex nature as well as lacking knowledge about their driving forces and potential effects make their analysis demanding: uncertainty about the modeling framework, inaccurate or incomplete event observations and the intrinsic randomness of the natural phenomenon add up to different interacting layers of uncertainty, which require a careful handling. Nevertheless deterministic approaches are still widely used in natural hazard assessments, holding the risk of underestimating the hazard with disastrous effects. The all-round probabilistic framework of Bayesian networks constitutes an attractive alternative. In contrast to deterministic proceedings, it treats response variables as well as explanatory variables as random variables making no difference between input and output variables. Using a graphical representation Bayesian networks encode the dependency relations between the variables in a directed acyclic graph: variables are represented as nodes and (in-)dependencies between variables as (missing) edges between the nodes. The joint distribution of all variables can thus be described by decomposing it, according to the depicted independences, into a product of local conditional probability distributions, which are defined by the parameters of the Bayesian network. In the framework of this thesis the Bayesian network approach is applied to different natural hazard domains (i.e. seismic hazard, flood damage and landslide assessments). Learning the network structure and parameters from data, Bayesian networks reveal relevant dependency relations between the included variables and help to gain knowledge about the underlying processes. The problem of Bayesian network learning is cast in a Bayesian framework, considering the network structure and parameters as random variables itself and searching for the most likely combination of both, which corresponds to the maximum a posteriori (MAP score) of their joint distribution given the observed data. Although well studied in theory the learning of Bayesian networks based on real-world data is usually not straight forward and requires an adoption of existing algorithms. Typically arising problems are the handling of continuous variables, incomplete observations and the interaction of both. Working with continuous distributions requires assumptions about the allowed families of distributions. To \"let the data speak\" and avoid wrong assumptions, continuous variables are instead discretized here, thus allowing for a completely data-driven and distribution-free learning. An extension of the MAP score, considering the discretization as random variable as well, is developed for an automatic multivariate discretization, that takes interactions between the variables into account. The discretization process is nested into the network learning and requires several iterations. Having to face incomplete observations on top, this may pose a computational burden. Iterative proceedings for missing value estimation become quickly infeasible. A more efficient albeit approximate method is used instead, estimating the missing values based only on the observations of variables directly interacting with the missing variable. Moreover natural hazard assessments often have a primary interest in a certain target variable. The discretization learned for this variable does not always have the required resolution for a good prediction performance. Finer resolutions for (conditional) continuous distributions are achieved with continuous approximations subsequent to the Bayesian network learning, using kernel density estimations or mixtures of truncated exponential functions. All our proceedings are completely data-driven. We thus avoid assumptions that require expert knowledge and instead provide domain independent solutions, that are applicable not only in other natural hazard assessments, but in a variety of domains struggling with uncertainties.",

            "Liquid crystal oligomers are shown to be model compounds for semi-flexible main chain LC polymers, and are a subject of topical interest due to their mesomorphic behaviour, which can differ greatly from that found for the corresponding low molar mass LCs. The aim of the research described in this thesis is to design, synthesize and characterize novel mesogenic dimers and trimers in which at least one mesogenic unit possesses a banana-shaped (bent-core) mesogen whereas the other is a calamitic moiety of different size. These compounds are suitable materials for studying the boundary between bent-core and calamitic compounds, which is shown by the existence of phase sequences combining nematic and/or SmA phases (characteristic for classical calamitic mesogens) with polar columnar and/or polar smectic phases (typical for bent-core mesogens). Numerous variations on the structure of the bent-core moiety and calamitic mesogenic units, the length and parity of the flexible spacer connecting the different mesogenic units, the nature of linking groups between the mesogenic units, as well as the fashion of linking the units were conducted.",

        "abstract": "Low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) are important nutrients for microbes. However, most LMWOAs do not exist freely in the environment but are bound to macromolecular organic matter, e.g. kerogen, lignite and coal. During burial and geological maturation of sedimentary macromolecular organic matter biological and abiological processes promote the liberation of LMWOAs into the surrounding sediment. Through this process, microbes in sedimentary subsurface environments are supplied with essential nutrients. To estimate the feedstock potential of buried macromolecular organic matter to many environments it is important to determine the amount of LMWOAs that are bound to such a matrix. However, high-pressure and high temperature are a key feature of deep subsurface environments, and these physical parameters have a profound influence on chemical reaction kinetics. Therefore it is essential for the estimation of the feedstock potential to generate high-pressure and high temperature for the liberation of LMWOAs to recreate true in-situ conditions. This work presents a newly developed, inexpensive incubation system for biological and geological samples. It allows the application of high-pressure and high temperature as well as a subsampling of the liquid phase without loss of pressure, thereby not disturbing the on-going processes. When simulating the liberation of LMWOAs from sedimentary organic matter, the newly developed incubation system produces more realistic results than other extraction systems like Soxhlet. The extraction products remain in the extraction medium throughout the extraction, influencing the chemical conditions of the extraction medium. Sub-bituminous coal samples from New Zealand as well as lignite samples from Germany were extracted at elevated temperature (90˚C) and pressure (5 MPa). The main LMWOAs released from these low rank coals were formate, acetate and oxalate. Extraction efficiency was increased by two to four times for formate, acetate and oxalate in comparison to existing extraction methods without pressurisation and with demineralised water. This shows the importance of pressure for the simulation of true in-situ conditions and suggests that the amount of bioavailable LMWOAs is higher than previously thought. With the increase in carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the enhanced recovery of oil and gas (EOR/EGR), more and more CO2 becomes injected into the underground. However, the effects of elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide on sedimentary organic matter are rarely investigated. As the incuabtion system allows the manipulation of the composition and partial pressure of dissolved gasses, the effect of highly gas-enriched (CO2, CO2/SO2, CO2/NO2; to simulate flue gas conditions) waters on the extraction yield of LMWOAs from macromolecular organic matter was evaluated. For sub-bituminous coal the concentrations of all LMWAOs decreased upon the addition of gas, irrespective of its composition, whereas for lignite formate always and acetate mostly increased, while oxalate decreased. This suggests an positive effect on the nutrient supply for the subsurface microbiota of lignite layers, as formate and acetate are the most common LMWOAs used for microbial metabolism. In terrestrial mud volcanoes (TMVs), sedimentary material is rapidly ascending from great depth to the surface. Therefore LMWOAs that were produced from buried macromolecular organic matter at depth are also brought up to the surface, and fuel heterotrophic microbial ecosystems at the surface. TMVs represent geochemically and microbiologically diverse habitats, which are supplied with organic substrates and electron acceptors from deep-seated hydrocarbon-generating systems and intersected shallow aquifers, respectively. The main electron donor in TMVs in Azerbaijan is sulphate, and microbial sulphate reduction leads to the production of a wide range of reduced sulphur species that are key players in several biological processes. In our study we estimated the effect of LMWOAs on the sulphur metabolising activity of microorganims in TMVs from Azerbaijan. The addition of a mixture of volatile fatty acids containing acetate and other LMWOAs showed significant positive response to the sulphate reduction rate (SRR) of samples of several mud volcanoes. Further investigations on the temperature dependency of the SRR and the characterisation of thermophilic sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) showed a connection between the deep hot subsurface and the surface",

        "abstract": "Printing technologies for the fabrication of electronic components have emerged in recent years and have attracted interest due to their capabilities of cost-effective material deposition and their suitability for large-area coatings. In this thesis, the benefits of inkjet printing technologies are used to manufacture piezoelectric actuators that are suitable for integration in polymer-based, disposable microfluidic lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems. Based on analytical models of actuator behavior, piezoelectric actuators with poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) as the active material are inkjet printed and characterized in detail for the first time here. The thermal treatment applied to the P(VDF-TrFE) films exhibits a significant influence on device performance and morphology. Annealing at temperatures between 110 and 140 °C yields distinct piezoelectric behavior. These findings are employed to demonstrate the function of a membrane pump with an inkjet printed actuator with pump rates up to 130 µL/min, which is suitable for applications in LOC systems. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the manufacturing approach introduced here as well as the established knowledge about the behavior of inkjet printed P(VDF-TrFE) actuators are novel. The low processing temperatures and the use of digital printing technologies lead to cost-effective processing compared to conventional, lithography- and vacuum-based manufacturing approaches. Different from most current micropumps, an additional assembly step is not required, which would be necessary when an actuator is manufactured separately and then attached to the pump membrane. Furthermore, the manufacturing approach and design introduced here are compatible with processes and materials that are used in LOC systems. They allow a cost-effective integration of further functionalities, leading to a higher degree of integration and thus smarter systems.",

Contributions in the field of spatiotemporal pulse generation and analysis have been driven by the quest for the observation, characterization, and understanding of various families of discrete Light Bullets (LBs) and developed in parallel to that. In this chapter we shall first give a brief summary of the results that have been obtained in this thesis and then discuss potential ramifications thereof as well as possible future directions of research, which are indicated as potentially fruitful by the results obtained here. Starting from commercial facilities for the generation of high-power, femtosecond, pulsed light sources at variable wavelengths in the near infrared we have implemented a spectral pulse shaper to generate pulses with arbitrary temporal profiles, at high peak powers, with a high throughput and without imaging aberrations. Spatial pulse shaping into a pulse with discrete orbital angular momentum was demonstrated with a discrete spiral phase plate technique. We gave an outlook onto a concept that might eventually lead to a truly spatiotemporal pulse shaping device. The concept is based on recent advances in the field of multicolor metamaterial holograms and would extend the concept of metasurface beam shaping into the spatiotemporal domain.",

        "abstract": "Alkali-silica reaction causes major problems in concrete structures due to the rapidity of its deformation which leads to the serviceability limit of the structure being reached well before its time. Factors that affect ASR vary greatly, including alkali and silica content, relative humidity, temperature and porosity of the cementitious matrix,all these making it a very complex phenomenon to consider explicitly. With this in mind, the finite element technique was used to build models and generate expansive pressures and damage propagation due to ASR under the influence of thermo-hygrochemoelastic loading. Since ASR initializes in the mesoscopic regions of the concrete, the accumulative effects of its expansion escalates onto the macroscale level with the development of web cracking on the concrete surface, hence solution of the damage model as well as simulation of the ASR phenomenon at both the macroscale and mesoscale levels have been performed. The macroscale model realizes the effects of ASR expansion as a whole and shows how it develops under the influence of moisture, thermal and mechanical loading. Results of the macroscale modeling are smeared throughout the structure and are sufficient to show how damage due to ASR expansion orientates. As opposed to the mesoscale model, the heterogeneity of the model shows us how difference in material properties between aggregates and the cementitious matrix facilitates ASR expansion. With both these models, the ASR phenomenon under influence of thermo-chemo-hygro-mechanical loading can be better understood.",

            "Non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma has drawn more and more attention to the field of wound healing research during the last two decades. It is characterized by a unique composition, which includes amongst others free radicals, ions and electrons. Furthermore, non-thermal plasma exhibits temperatures that are below those inducing thermal cell damage. Next to its well-established anti-bacterial properties, plasma can have lethal as well as stimulating effects on mammalian cells. Therefore, the medical application of non-thermal plasma on chronic wounds seems to be a promising tool to enable healing processes. However, less is known about the plasma-mediated induction of intracellular signaling pathways in human immune cells, which play a leading part in the process of wound recovery and removal of pathogens. Therefore, this thesis examined the cellular effects of a non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma treatment on human immune cells using the argon plasma jet kinpen 09. Here, the CD4+ T helper cell line Jurkat, the monocyte cell line THP-1 as well as the corresponding primary cells were investigated. First, cell survival and apoptosis induction was assessed in response to non-thermal plasma treatment by growth curves and flow cytometric assays. On the one hand it could be shown that primary cells are more susceptible to plasma treatment than the respective cell lines.

        "abstract": "The private provision of public goods (PPPG) is still one of the most fascinating puzzles in economics. Underpredicted by standard economic theory but outrightly evident in empirical evidence, its presence opened doors for new methods to enter the economist's toolkit and helped birthing the nowadays more vibrant than ever field of behavioral economics. Variants of the question of what determines giving in PPPG make up, for the most part, the research questions of the five articles that constitute this dissertation. Residing on the overlap of public economics, environmental economics, and behavioral/experimental economics, it reports on two field-experimental and one lab-experimental projects, delivering results with respect to, for example, the price elasticity of giving to public goods, the willingness to pay for a voluntary one-ton emissions reduction, the pronounced effect of education on PPPG, the \"pure\" effect of group size in public good provision, and the effects of ambient noise and outdoor temperature on PPPG.",

The power system can be characterized due to its size, complexity and load unknown in advance, in addition to time variability. Since large electric power is transferred, even small changes in setting can frequently represent significant economic savings. Regarding the power system properties as well as the basics of secondary control, it is obvious that the optimal selection of pilot bus plays an important role in the quality of control and the related economic impact. The monograph focuses on the methods of optimal selection of the pilot buses for the dispatch control of bus voltage in a complex power system. The aim is to modify them so that it is possible to investigate the issue via using the parallelism principle and grid computer structure aimed at multiple shortening of the computing time.",

        "abstract": "This thesis is dedicated to the release and immobilization of As5+ and Sb5+ in contaminated geomaterials. Although the physical properties and chemical composition of the contaminated materials vary widely, the mechanisms, which control the fate of the contaminants are supposedly similar. In order to understand these mechanisms, I carried out a mineralogical and geochemical investigation of a soil, which was mixed with contaminated As-rich ash waste. With techniques including powder-PXRD, ICP-MS, sequential extractions, EMPA and synchrotron based µ-XRD and XANES, the carriers of As5+ in the fresh ash waste and soil-ash mixtures were identified and characterized. Glass particles and unburned coal particles with veinlets of As-rich calcite are the main carriers of As5+. In the soil-ash mixtures, the soluble As5+ containing phases of the ash-waste almost completely disappeared and As5+ migrated into the soil components, presumably consisting of iron oxides. In the following study, the immobilization of As5+ by iron oxides in the context of As5+ incorporation in hematite was investigated. As5+-ferrihydrite was transformed to hematite and examined by ICP-MS, powder-XRD, SEM, TEM, and EXAFS spectroscopy. The results show that As5+ can be incorporated into hematite with concentrations of 1.9 wt%. This novel immobilization mechanism encouraged me to investigate the possibility of Sb5+ incorporation into iron oxides in a subsequent study. Ferrihydrite was doped with different concentrations of Sb5+, As5+, and P5+ and transformed to more-well crystalline products. The transformation products were analyzed and characterized by ICP-MS, PXRD, SEM and TEM. The results show that Sb5+ directly controls the outcome of the ferrihydrite transformation and therefore the transformation products. These transformation products contain Sb5+ with up to 14 wt.%, exceeding an exclusive adsorption mechanism by far, suggesting structural incorporation of Sb5+ into the iron oxides.",

Neben therapeutisch erforderlichen Ernährungsmaßnahmen und dauerhafter Gewichtsreduktion, werden eine optimale Makronährstoffzusammensetzung und mögliche protektive Wirkungen, zum Beispiel der alpha-Linolensäure (ALA), diskutiert. Daher wurde eine sechsmonatige kontrollierte Ernährungsstudie bei MBS-Patienten mit dem Ziel durchgeführt, die Effekte eines neuen hypoenergetischen Ernährungskonzeptes auf Körpergewicht und Risikoprofil sowie mögliche Wirkungen einer erhöhten ALA-Zufuhr zu untersuchen. Letzeres erfolgte durch den Vergleich von Rapsöl zu Olivenöl in zwei Studiengruppen. Nach der Intervention waren in beiden Gruppen Körpergewicht, Blutdruck und die Konzentrationen von Parametern u.a. des Lipid- und Endothelstoffwechsels, sowie das MBS-Vorkommen signifikant reduziert. Intergruppenunterschiede zeigten sich durch signifikant größere Reduktionen des diastolischen Blutdrucks sowie der TAG- und YKL-40-Konzentrationen in der Rapsölgruppe und deuten auf eigenständige ALA-Wirkungen hin.",

Improved nutritional habits and an enduring weight reduction are essential for therapy. However, the optimal macronutrient composition and metabolically favourable food components, such as alpha-linolenic acid, are still a matter of debate. We investigated the effects of a hypoenergetic diet over six month in patients with the MBS on body weight and risk profile as well as possible effects of an increased ALA-intake. The latter was realised by comparison of rapeseed oil and olive oil in two intervention groups. After intervention, body weight, blood pressure and parameters of lipid and endothelial metabolism as well as prevalence of the metabolic syndrome were significantly reduced. Differences between groups were investigated for significantly more declined diastolic blood pressure, concentrations of serum TAG as well as YKL-40 after rapeseed oil diet. This could indicate an individual effect of ALA.",

            "Zusammenfassung: The free energy landscape is a key quantity to represent and understand biomolecular processes like folding, molecular recognition and aggregation. While most experiments reveal structural properties of biomolecules, theoretical methods like molecular dynamics simulations additionally generate dynamical information at the microscopic level. Thanks to the development of optimized algorithms together with an increase in computational power, complex biomolecular processes can be directly simulated up to a time scale of microseconds. The studies in this thesis were motivated by a lack of proper methods to construct the free energy landscape for a speci c class of molecules, that is, nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA, and for a particular process, peptide aggregation. To study the energy landscape of nucleic acids,  rst various kinds of collective variables are introduced. Internal coordinates are shown to give a better resolution of the energy landscape while keeping information about the intramolecular structure of the molecule. As an intriguing example, the analysis strategy is applied to the binding mechanism and speci city of a RNA riboswitch, i.e., a small molecule that can trigger gene expression. Finally, the focus is on peptide aggregation, a molecular mechanism of biomedical interest due to the relation between amyloid formation and degenerative between the di erent states occurring during the process, while keeping trace of the intramolecular and intermolecular information. Applied to several model systems, the new theoretical approaches and developments are shown to lead to a better microscopic understanding of complex biomolecular processes",
            "Zusammenfassung: La superficie di energia libera è una grandezza fondamentale per rappresentare e comprendere processi biomolecolari come il folding, il riconoscimento molecolare e l’aggregazione. Mentre la maggior parte degli esperimenti rivelano proprietà strutturali delle biomolecole, metodi teorici come simulazioni di dinamica molecolare generano informazioni dinamiche a livello microscopico. Grazie allo sviluppo di algoritmi ottimizzati insieme ad un aumento della potenza di calcolo, processi biomolecolari complessi possono essere direttamente simulati fino ad una scala temporale di microsecondi.Gli studi in questa tesi erano motivati da una mancanza di metodi adeguati per costruire la superficie di energia libera per una classe di molecole specifica, i.e., gli acidi nucleici come DNA e RNA, e per un particolare processo, i.e., l’aggregazione di peptidi. Per studiare la superficie di energia libera degli acidi nucleici, inizialmente sono introdotti vari tipi di variabili collettive. Coordinate interne si sono rivelate dare una migliore risoluzione della superficie di energia libera, mantenendo informazioni sulla struttura intramolecolare della molecola. Come esempio interessante, la strategia di analisi viene applicata al meccanismo di binding e la specificità di un RNA riboswitch, una piccola molecola che può attivare l'espressione genica. Infine, l'attenzione è rivolta all’aggregazione peptidica, un meccanismo molecolare di interesse biomedico a causa della relazione fra la formazione amiloide e malattie degenerative. Viene proposto un nuovo metodo che sia in grado di discriminare tra i diversi stati che si verificano durante il processo, mantenendo traccia delle informazioni intramolecolare e intermolecolare. Applicato a diversi sistemi modello, i nuovi approcci e sviluppi teorici sono dimostrati portare ad una migliore comprensione microscopica dei processi biomolecolari complessi"

            "In this work a semi-automatic approach for the optimization of hardware architectures of safety-critical embedded systems is presented that supports developers in extending already existing systems with additional functionality given as software tasks. A two-tier optimization process explores the design space for valid allocations of the software tasks to the hardware architecture. The method exploits that large embedded systems typically are hierarchically composed of hardware subsystems: A global optimization step computes pre-allocations of all software tasks onto subsystems based on an abstract notion of the computation capacity. Separately for each subsystem, those tasks are then allocated to processors by local optimization steps such that they are schedulable and all constraints are satisfied. For both the global and the local optimization problem exact optimization methods bundled with experimental results are presented. <engl.>",

The process of the Post Conflict Development is to be very hard to investigate, primarily for the combination of socio-cultural phenomena, war and political instability; having difficulties of conducting solid empirical analysis (obtaining reliable data) and dealing with war-torn communities. The multifaceted process of the reconstruction is ought to touch a lot of countries vital segments, whereas each of them requires different approach; coordination with one another; and unification in their common aim. The emergency of the assistance programs are not equal, same as with the priority and weight when compared with each other, therefore occasionally there are programs for the success of which the other less important actions are violated or neglected. The case is with the International Community presence ( the set up), which aside from their mission and projects, it is considered to play a very important role on the urban development of a post conflict city; the setting was never planned or considered in a holistic manner, therefore IC establishment was done ad hoc and it was guided by issues which did not help at its greatest to the urban development of the city and more over to the citizens who were most in need. The study is about the Urban Development, due to the fact that the biggest concentration of the International Community is likely to be in the urban centers, and the experienced changes are of a much considerable magnitude. The reconstruction phase is likely to be lasting at about 10 years and more , consequently the International Community for that time being tends to be recognized as temporary citizens of the city, and it is inevitably that they will be having an impact on the urban development of the city; in that basis it is considered to be significant that the International Community Establishment/Set Up be included into the International Organizations mission and assist in the overall mission of the reconstruction.",

The enormous effort dedicated to the ab initio description of the properties of materials is increasing exponentially based on advances of calculations taking the quasiparticle electronic structure, excitonic effects and local field effects into consideration. In this work, it was modeled properties of group-III nitrides and their alloys by means of ab initio methods. The ground-state (energetic, structural, elastic) and excited-state (energy bands, band parameters, dielectric functions) properties of the zincblend and the wurtzite polytypes of AlN, GaN, InN, and their “wurtzitic” alloys InxGa1-xN and InxAl1-xN are investigated within a cluster expansion approach using density functional theory together with the AM05 exchange-correlation functional. The total energies and the optimized atomic geometries of all 22 clusters classes of the cluster expansion for each compound are calculated. The computationally demanding calculation of the corresponding quasiparticle electronic structures is achieved for all cluster classes by means of a recently developed scheme to approximately solve the quasiparticle equation based on the HSE06 hybrid functional and the G0W0 approach. Using two different alloy statistics, strict-regular solution model and microscopic decomposition model, the configurational averages are calculated. The composition-dependent electronic structures of the alloys are discussed based on configurationally averaged properties of the ground and excited states. The influence of the alloy statistics on the composition dependencies and the corresponding bowing parameters of the band gaps is found to be significant and should, hence, lead to different signatures in the optical-absorption or -emission spectra of these Materials.",

It is further shown by a comprehensive literature review that individual values of personality traits relate to social engineering susceptibility. Based on these arguments, a framework is proposed, which can help to guide future research. Suggestions to plausible relations between the personality traits of the Big 5 Theory and the principles of influence are made. These relations need to be evaluated by future research. Lastly, an integrated approach to prevention against social engineering attacks is proposed, which combines penetration tests using social engineering, security awareness trainings, and the development of a security-aware organizational culture. The methodology used in conducting this investigation is a theoretical, positive research approach. Extensive literature reviews have been conducted on social engineering, psychology of persuasion and the influence of personality traits on the success of social engineering attacks. Based on an analysis and discussion of these reviews, proposals for a new framework and a prevention approach have been developed.",

NCAM spielt eine entscheidende Rolle während der Embryonalentwicklung und ist außerordentlich wichtig für die Aufrechterhaltung des Nervensystems. Homophile NCAM-Bindungen vermitteln Adhäsion zwischen Zellen und führen zu einer Aktivierung eines komplexen Netzes intrazellulärer Signalkaskaden. NCAM besitzt neben der extrazellulären Domäne, die aus fünf Ig-artigen Domänen und zwei membrannahen Fibronektin-Typ-III-homologen Domänen besteht, auch eine große cytoplasmatische Domäne. Diese cytoplasmatische Domäne spielt eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Signalweiterleitung und beim NCAM-induzierten Neuritenwachstum. Sie besitzt, abhängig von der Isoform, bis zu 49 potentielle Phosphorylierungsstellen. Obwohl bekannt ist, dass es beim NCAM-induzierten Neuritenwachstum zu einer verstärkten Phosphorylierung der cytoplasmatischen Domäne von NCAM kommt, war bisher nicht bekannt, welche der Phosphorylierungsstellen daran beteiligt sind. In dieser Arbeit wurde gezeigt, dass die potentielle Phosphorylierungsstelle an Serin 774 für das NCAM-vermittelte Neuritenwachstum und die Aktivierung des Transkriptionsfaktors CREB (cAMP responsive element binding protein) notwendig ist. Weiterhin konnte gezeigt werden, dass die Aminosäure Serin an Position 774 in Signaltransduktionswegen und der Endozytose von NCAM involviert ist.",

It is implicated in various functions during development and maintenance of the nervous system. Homophilic NCAM binding mediates cell adhesion and leads to the activation of a complex network of intracellular signaling cascades. NCAM possesses an extracellular domain, which consists of five immunoglobulin-like domains and two fibronectin-type-III-domains. Apart from that NCAM also has a large intracellular domain, which plays an important role in signal transduction and during NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth. This cytoplasmic domain of NCAM contains, depending on the isoform, up to 49 potential phosphorylation sites. Although it is known that during the NCAM-induced neurite outgrowth the phosphorylation of the intracellular domain increases, it is not yet known which phosphorylation sites are involved. We have indentified that serine 774 of NCAM140 is necessary for NCAM-mediated neurite outgrowth and activation of the transcription factor CREB (cAMP responsive element binding protein). Furthermore we could show, that serine 774 is involved in signal transduction and endocytosis of NCAM."

            "For developers, the integration of service protocols into applications is still a tedious and time-consuming task. This problem can be solved by programming software that converts one protocol to another. Thereby, design-patterns, data transformation technologies or manual coding are used to integrate these protocols. Also, several model-driven solutions can be used that focus on the formal description of protocols to automatically generate converters.  This thesis describes a model-driven approach that has been designed to convert service protocols into each other. The approach focuses on the modeling of the differences between protocols. The differences in the communication behavior are described using patterns, while the state of a service can be described using decision trees. The evaluation contains an analysis of the processing times of the patterns as well as a comparison with other model-driven approaches. <engl.>",

            "To inspect the bonding of historically valuable wall paintings a laser-optical vibration measurement method based on Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) has proved quite powerful. Its further development requires an acoustic excitation system in the audio range of high directivity. A parametric acoustic system was built for this purpose, where highly directional audio sound is produced by nonlinear effects from directionally radiated ultrasound. Initially, these sound fields showed unexpected properties. Their causes were identified and solutions to overcome them were developed. For this purpose it was necessary to know the 3D ultrasonic field in front of the transducer array. The ESPI-measuring method was enhanced accordingly for the investigation of sound fields. The results were used to specifically modify the ultrasonic field to obtain the desired high directivity in the audio range. The characteristics of the final parametric system are discussed. <engl.>",

            "Marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a major player in global biogeochemical cycles. Here, DOM was studied for the first time with optical and molecular methods in a subterranean estuary (STE) and it was compared to a surface estuary, both in Florida, USA. I hypothesized that STEs are important sources of DOM to the coastal ocean. I developed novel statistical tools for multivariate data interpretation. As a main result, I could show that coastal sediments are major sources of DOM to the coastal ocean. In the surface estuary, mixing of fresh- and seawater was the main driver for DOM concentration and composition, while in the STE microbial processing dominated over mixing. By statistically combining the results from ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, FT-ICR-MS), fluorescence spectroscopy and other chemical water analysis, I identified major DOM sources in the two estuarine systems. Furthermore, I proposed novel optical monitoring tools for in situ continuous monitoring in coastal systems. <engl.>",

Overhead costs occur, the targeted circuit is slowed down, and in general the total impact of the power-gating technique is hard to predict at early design stages. The goal of this thesis is to develop power-gating models for functional units at RT-level to enable design tradeoffs and to optimize the high-level synthesis for the use of this design technique. Main contributions of this work are models for estimating the functional unit’s energy demand during active and sleep state as well as during a state transition, optimized scheduling, binding, and allocation approaches to increase the profitability of power-gating, and a consistent design flow of the high-level synthesis decisions to subsequent design tools. The models estimate the energy reduction of functional RT-level components to be 46% in average. The optimized synthesis approaches can even further reduce the remaining energy demand by up to 43% at an average reduction of 19.8%. <engl.>",

            "The soil living, Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis is frequently exposed to a wide variety of stress and starvation conditions in its natural environment. In order to survive under these environmental and energy stresses, the bacterium acquired a general stress response mechanism mediated by the alternative sigma factor, SigB. A wide-variety of stress conditions such as environmental stress conditions like ethanol stress, heat stress, oxidative stress, osmotic stress or limitation of glucose, oxygen, phosphate etc.; and low temperature growth induce this SigB-dependent general stress response. Though much is known about the mechanisms of activation of this general stress response, the conditions that induce the SigB regulon and its general functions, the definition of the structure of the SigB regulon is not completely clear. The SigB-dependent general stress regulon has previously been characterized by proteomic approaches as well as DNA-array based expression studies. Genome-wide expression studies performed by Price, Petersohn and Helmann defined the SigB regulon containing well above 100 target genes, however the overlapping list of target genes contains only 67 members. The differences between these studies probably result from the different strains, growth conditions, array platforms and experimental setups used in these studies.

        "abstract": "Abstract: The PC12 cell line is a well-established cell model system for analysing cell fate decisionmaking processes. When stimulated with the growth factor EGF the cells proliferate increasingly, when stimulated with the nerve growth factor NGF the cells differentiate into sympathetic-like neurons. Both processes are regulated via the ERK/MAPK pathway. In this context, signal duration of activated ERK seems to be the key mechanism for the emergence of the distinct cell fates. Whereas NGF stimulation results in sustained ERK activation and neuronal differentiation of the cell line, EGF stimulation activates ERK transiently and results in enhanced cell proliferation. How the temporal dynamics of ERK signalling are encoded and translated in order to specify cell fates has not been fully understood yet. <br>This thesis is the first comparison of the EGF and NGF induced transcriptome of PC12 cells on a time scale of 24 hours with high sample density. It was shown that the EGF and NGF stimulus activate a very similar set of genes, which initiates and modulates the cell fate decision. These genes’ expression dynamics, however, were different depending on the stimulus used: EGF stimulation induced a short impulse-like gene expression pattern, whereas NGF stimulation resulted in a long-sustained response. In line with previous studies it was demonstrated, that immediate early genes such as Egr1, Fos and Junb show an increased stability in the case of NGF stimulation. It was shown, that this is most likely due to a delayed negative transcriptional feedback via Fosl1, Atf3, Maff, Klf2 und Zfp36l2. Moreover it was demonstrated, that both cell fates, proliferation as well as differentiation, are not solely dependent on the ERK/MAPK pathway. Within the first hour after stimulation with EGF cross-talk between the MAPK and PI3K pathways seems necessary in order to induce enhanced cell proliferation. After stimulation with NGF a more complex and sequential activation of different pathways was identified. In this context the activation of the Il6 pathway and the uPA/uPAR complex seems to be of special importance. The activation of these two pathways was exclusively seen after NGF-stimulation, which encourages further research to gain a deeper understanding of their function in the process of neuronal differentiation. Additionally, Dusp6 was identified as a potentially important modulator of the PC12 cell fate. In summary, this thesis analyses and compares the EGF and NG ...",

The second chapter provides an overview about the influence of the polymer architecture on its characterization by mass spectrometry and complementary methods. In the third chapter, we demonstrate the use of MS, more specifically MALDI-ToF MS, which provides molar masses and dispersity values for poly(furfuryl glycidyl ether) (PFGE). The second example is the study of poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNiPAm) copolymers with glyco-monomers with specific combinations of matrices and cationization agents. The fourth chapter will combine three different examples regarding linear, star-shaped and hybrid polymers, which were analyzed by advanced techniques. The linear copolymers were analyzed by separating them according to their chemical heterogeneity using liquid absorption chromatography at critical conditions (LACCC) of poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEtOx), followed by automated spotting onto a MALDI target, which was subsequently analyzed by MALDI. Secondly, star-shaped polymers: [poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-b-PEtOx]8 were monitored firstly by using LACCC of linear PEO as first separation dimension and furthermore injected onto an SEC column confirming the molar mass. Lastly, a hybrid PEO star-shaped polymer was investigated using MALDI to verify the complete functionality of the core with PEO arms. Finally, the last chapter will focus on the creation of a software to obtain information regarding average composition, overcoming isotopic, overlapping peaks and isobaric species from MS spectra. Moreover, the quantitative studies were carried out by correction of the mass discrimination and isotopic abundance. Consequently, advanced analytical techniques such as different ionization techniques within MS, a range of chromatographic hyphenation and computational methods are implemented for elucidating the complexity of synthetic polymers.",

In this case, idea of pattern of activities in a society that is core of a culture becomes main factor in process of formation of houses and environment in a settlement. Factors which affecting form (physical) of architecture in a settlement environment are socio-cultural, economic, and religious determinant factor that manifested architectural realization (Rapoport, 1969). Yogyakarta as the continuation of kingdom city in the Java Island finally exists as an Islamic kingdom that still remain to survive up to now. Impacts of this issue is appearance of various Moslem settlements to support typical character of an Islamic Kingdom. Mlangi is an area of oldest Moslem settlements in Yogyakarta has not been explored in details for progress especially in physical glasses recently. Everything basic group and individual who arrange houses and residences, starts from how it has spatial concept alone. Although concept is a very abstract thing to explain in details, but its existence can be detected by how they created their physical environment. This research conducted by these research questions: (1) What are spatial concepts owned by people in Mlangi and (2) How do spatial concepts owned by the people affect the settlements pattern? Process to search spatial concept owned by the people in Moslem residence, making Mlangi as study area, was approached by using phenomenological research method. The researcher have to self-involved directly in unstructured interviews, but remained in guideline framework of in interviews to make research process effective. Fistly, the researcher interviewed the key person, they are the head of Mlangi administration (pak Dukuh) in Mlangi and Sawahan. They were then give advices to who was capable person that could draw the spatial concept and had many story and knew the history of the settlements. Step by step of interview guided from one informant to next informant when the information had been told repeatedly. The next informant based on the last informant advice or who had close relationship with the last theme appeared. To complete the narration and draw the result of interview, researcher have to add additional information with photograph and descriptive picture that can be draw the settlement empirically. In process, 17 information units which found in field were consistent with sequence of interview events and flowing of theme to theme associated with Moslem residence of residence. Finally the interviews succeeded in abstracting 16 themes that may be classified into historic, socio-cultural, and spatial-concept dimensions in Mlangi. Process of analysis to find spatial concept owned by the people in Moslem settlements was carried out by dialogue of themes to find available substantive relationship. Four concepts successfully analyzed consist of concepts of personage, concept of religious implementation, concept of Jero-Jaba and concept of Interest. The four concepts are really associated with one and others in understanding how spatial concept owned by the people affects residence they occupy. Yet, concept of Jero-Jaba bases all concepts of people in Mlangi . This concept can be used to draw red yarn on how they utilize communal spaces in residence and layout rooms of their individual houses. This concept also eternalize residence patterns existing in Mlangi now where residence does not experience many changes from starting of this residence existence (from detection of generation currently still living), namely residence patterns concentrate on orientation to Masjid Pathok Negoro of Mlangi. This research was opening the potential research area, at least for the sociology, anthropology and demography research interest. So many unique character in Mlangi if looked at from how they maintain their spatial concept and manifested in their daily activities. How the people will concern only for the religious activities and the economic concern only for survival aspect in live.

        "abstract": "By means of the functional renormalization group (FRG), systems can be described in a nonperturbative way. The derived flow equations are solved via pseudo-spectral methods. As they allow to resolve the full field dependence of the effective potential and provide highly accurate results, these numerical methods are very powerful but have hardly been used in the FRG context. We show their benefits using several examples. Moreover, we apply the pseudo-spectral methods to explore the phase diagram of a bosonic model with two coupled order parameters and to clarify the nature of a possible metastability of the Higgs-Yukawa potential.In the phase diagram of systems with two competing order parameters, fixed points govern multicritical behavior. Such systems are often discussed in the context of condensed matter. Considering the phase diagram of the bosonic model between two and three dimensions, we discover additional fixed points besides the well-known ones from studies in three dimensions. Interestingly, our findings suggest that in certain regions of the phase diagram, two universality classes coexist. To our knowledge, this is the first bosonic model where coexisting (multi-)criticalities are found. Also, the absence of nontrivial fixed points can have a physical meaning, such as in the electroweak sector of the standard model which suffers from the triviality problem. The electroweak transition giving rise to the Higgs mechanism is dominated by the Gaussian fixed point. Due to the low Higgs mass, perturbative calculations suggest a metastable potential. However, the existence of the lower Higgs-mass bound eventually is interrelated with the maximal ultraviolet extension of the standard model. A relaxation of the lower bound would mean that the standard model may be still valid to even higher scales. Within a simple Higgs-Yukawa model, we discuss the origin of metastabilities and mechanisms, which relax the Higgs-mass bound, including higher field operators.",

We study the transfer operator (which acts on the space of continuous functions on the self-similar set) and the Hutchinson operator (which acts on the space of Borel regular measures on the self-similar set). We show that the transfer operator has an infinitely countable set of polynomial eigenfunctions. These eigenfunctions can be regarded as generalized Bernoulli polynomials. The polynomial eigenfuctions define a polynomial approximation of the self-similar measure. We also study the moments of the self-similar measure and give recursions for computing them. Further, we develop a numerical method based on Markov chains to study the spectrum of the Hutchinson and transfer operators. This method provides numerical approximations of the invariant measure for which we give error bounds in terms of the Wasserstein-distance. The standard example in this thesis is the parametric family of Bernoulli convolutions."

Battery systems are among the most important technologies of the 21st century since they are enablers for the market success of electric vehicles and stationary energy storage solutions. However, the performance of batteries so far has limited possible applications. Addressing this challenge requires an interdisciplinary understanding of dynamic cause-effect relationships between processes, equipment, materials, and environmental conditions. The approach in this book supports the integrated evaluation of improvement measures and is usable for different planning horizons. It is applied to an exemplary battery cell production and module assembly in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and potential benefits of the simulation",

According to Ji's sum-rule, the forward limit of the GPDs is directly linked to the total angular momenta of quarks and gluons. The exclusive measurement of deeply-virtual Compton scattering presents a promising experimental approach. The COMPASS-II experiment at CERN is designed to carry out these measurements. A profound understanding of the experimental acceptance and background estimates is key to measure absolute cross sections and can only be obtained with Monte Carlo.This thesis comprises the development of the new Geant4-based Monte Carlo Software TGEANT for the COMPASS-II experiment. TGEANT was optimized primarily for the GPD program, including a tuning of the electromagnetic shower simulation and a software model of the trigger system, but has since been extended to cover all other physics programs. It has become a standard in the COMPASS-II Monte Carlo chain and has been used by almost all recent analyses",

        "abstract": "This work covers electron positron pair production in spatially homogeneous electric (and magnetic) fields. Different field configurations are looked at in order to study various phenomena including multiphoton pair production, Sauter-Schwinger pair production and dynamically assisted pair production. The main focus lies on pulsed, rotating fields with one main frequency component which are called rotating Sauter pulses. The results are obtained via different numerical methods, that rest on different theoretical approaches. A generic method is derived from the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism which entails a modified quantum kinetic equation. We call the numerical solution of this equation the Wigner method. Other types of equations are derived from the DHW formalism as well and numerically solved with the aim to include magnetic fields. In the case of rotating Sauter pulses a completely different numerical method is developed, which is based on a semiclassical approach and therefore called the semiclassical method. A number of parameter studies are conducted to understand pair production in these rotating Sauter pulses. In those studies the Wigner method and the semiclassical method are compared exhaustively and found to complement each other. This makes it possible to cover the complete range of parameters of the rotating Sauter pulse, which helps to calculate the pair production rates for experiments involving counter-propagating circularly polarized laser light. An interpretation of the resulting pair production spectra is given. Due to the general nature of the Wigner method it is possible to study more general field configurations which include pulses with elliptic polarization, chirped pulses or bichromatic rotating Sauter pulses. Each of these exhibit interesting features, including the dynamically assisted Schwinger effect in bichromatic pulses, which could be useful in planning high-intensity laser experiments.",

        "abstract": "The heterogeneous physicochemical properties of biofilm and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) play an important role in deciding the fate of transport of nanoparticles in subsurface. However, contrasting results have been observed for the mobility of different nanoparticle transport in porous media coated with biofilms. Also, no comparative studies ave been done linking the effect of biofilms on colloidal stability and mobility of colloids to date. Laboratory scale experiments were conducted to obtain insights into different ways bacterial biofilms and EPS can influence the transport of nanoparticles in porous media. Using complementary experimental approaches, we investigated (1) the effect of microbial EPS on the colloidal stability of nanoparticles, (2a.) the transport of uncoated colloidal nanoparticles in biofilm and EPS-coated porous media, (2b.) the transport of EPS-coated colloidal nanoparticles in uncoated porous media (2c), the combined transport of EPS-coated colloids in biofilm and EPS-coated porous media, and finally (3) the remobilization of deposited colloidal nanoparticles by EPS. Laboratory synthesized hematite nanoparticles (HNP) and Bacillus subtilis 168 (DSM 402) were used as nanoparticles and biofilm forming bacterium respectively. To study the effect of EPS on the colloidal stability, HNP were amended with three increasing concentrations of EPS (20, 200 and 500 mg/l carbon) resulting in carbon:iron ratios 1:5, 2:1 and 5:1, respectively. The zeta potential (ZP), the shift in isoelectric point and the change in the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) for NaCl and CaCl2 showed formation of colloidally stable organo-mineral colloids at higher concentrations of EPS (200 mg/l and 500 mg/l of carbon, HNP2:1, HNP 5:1). However, lower concentrations of EPS (20 mg/l carbon, HNP 1:5) resulted into aggregation of HNP. The transport of uncoated and EPS-coated HNP colloids at environmental pH was studied with closed flow columns experiments in three different synthetic porous media, i.e., uncoated, biofilm-coated, and EPS-coated glass beads. No drastic change was observed in the pH and the electrical conductivity of the system during the transport experiments. However, a constant amount of organic matter and bacterial cells were continuously released from the porous media coatings. In the first scenario, positively charged uncoated HNP were immobile and retained in uncoated-glass bead porous media. Contrary, a mobile fraction of negatively charged HNP was observed in biofilms and EPS-coated porous media. The charge reversal of HNP during transport is due to adsorption of organic matter released from the coatings forming organomineral associations of HNP and components of the biofilm or EPS.",

        "abstract": "Nanotechnology is a buzzword in context of the proceeding miniaturization of devices and their components. Nanoparticles (NPs) can nowadays easily be synthesized from different material compositions by different chemical and physical processes. However, most of these techniques work close to or at the thermal equilibrium. One subsequent approach to tune materials beyond equilibrium conditions is ion beam irradiation. An important effect of this approach is sputtering. Sputtering is enhanced in NPs compared to their bulk counterparts due to their large surface-to-volume ratio, especially when the ion range matches the NP size. In this work, the sputtering effects of Ar+ and Ga+ ion irradiated Au nanoparticles are investigated in detail by Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and a variety of experiments. The sputtering of Ar+ and Ga+ irradiated Au NPs was investigated as a function of ion energy, NP size and impact parameter by the MC code iradina and MD code parcas. The simulation results are directly compared to experiments using high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of Au NPs on top of Si, whereat the sputter yields are significantly enhanced compared to the MC simulations. Additionally, the interaction of NPs and substrate were investigated by Rutherford backscatter spectrometry (RBS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). A new MC code was developed to study the redeposition of sputtered atoms of Ga+ irradiated Au NP arrays on neighboring NPs. The redeposition can lead to growth of NPs with diameters of 1 nm in vicinity of ~50 nm NP. These simulations are directly compared to an in situ experiment. Nanostructures, spherical NPs as well as nanowires (NWs) are used as irradiation masks to structure lithium niobate (LNO) using the ion beam enhanced etching (IBEE) technique. The aspect ratio of the obtained structures can be enhanced by a second IBEE step after annealing.",

        "abstract": "Diatoms are key players in the aquatic ecosystem as they significantly contribute to photosynthetic carbon assimilation and transfer of energy to higher trophic levels. Some of these single celled algae produce polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs), which are derived from enzymatic oxidation of fatty acids. These aldehydes are known to inter¬fere with the reproduction of their predators and have been suggested to act as info- and allelochemicals. Compared to the biological functions of PUAs, their mechanisms of action have been less investigated. Here, I present PUA quantification data for plankton communities and provide experimen¬tal results for an enhanced mechanistic understanding of these oxylipins. To perform the studies, I estab¬lished fluorescent probes according to the activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) strategy on the basis of PUAs and bioinactive saturated aldehydes. I developed key methodological approaches (feeding and two-step incubation protocols, procedures for fluoescence microscopy) and a novel probe reporter that is a useful and universal tool in chemical biology. Uptake studies showed that the PUA-derived probe entered algal cells and accumulated in the gonads of a predator. Moreover, investigation of targets based on covalent reactions with PUAs revealed several labeled proteins in a diatom. This first proteomic approach suggests that key metabolic pathways are affected by PUAs.",

        "abstract": "Symbiosis is ubiquitous in nature and can play a crucial role in shaping the biology of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Importantly, the interaction of microorganisms with eukaryotes can range from pathogenicity to mutualism, also shifting along this continuum. The ecological settings facilitating such lifestyle transitions are, however, poorly understood.  This dissertation focuses on the symbiosis between Lagriinae beetles and Burkholderia gladioli, a bacterium mostly known for its plant pathogenic traits. In Lagria hirta and Lagria villosa beetles, I localized these bacteria on adults, larvae and eggs of both species confirming a vertical transmission route. The presence of B. gladioli in these and four other Lagriinae species suggested that the association is relatively ancient and evolved within this phytopathogenic bacterial group. Additionally, B. gladioli from L. villosa can successfully infect soybean plants, a food source for this beetle species, and negatively affect the plant’s reproductive output, implying that the insect symbiont conserves the ability to intimately interact with a plant. Presumably, the potential of plant pathogenic B. gladioli bacteria to produce potent bioactive substances was also essential for establishing a mutualism with the insect. In L. villosa beetles, I could show that B. gladioli on the surface of eggs inhibit the growth of antagonistic fungi. I thereby demonstrate a symbiont-mediated defense, which could be highly advantageous at the nutrient-rich and immobile egg stage. Furthermore, we elucidated four compounds (toxoflavin, caryoynencin, lagriene and lagriamide) that could be responsible for the protective effect by the symbionts. Finally, multiple symbiotic B. gladioli strains were found coexisting in individual beetles, bringing about interesting questions regarding the potential advantages of strain diversity in defensive symbiosis and the evolutionary dynamics supporting their long-term maintenance.",

An understanding of the dynamics of viral mutant genotypes aids in the assessment of treatment failure with a certain drug combination, and exploring potential salvage treatment regimens.

        "abstract": "Research of solute transport fundamentally contributes to our understanding of soil functions as most processes in soils are dynamically driven and related to the transient conditions produced by the transport of solutes. For this reason, especially the transport of contaminants is frequently studied with laboratory scale column outflow experiments in an open-flow mode. This thesis presents a complementary approach of conducting saturated column experiments that is characterized by the recirculation of the effluent into the inflow via a mixing vessel and is therefore referred to as closed-flow mode column experiment. Depending on the ratio of the volume of the mixing vessel and the water-filled pore space, a damped oscillating concentration emerges in the effluent and in the mixing vessel. Oscillation frequency, damping and amplitude are thereby governed by the properties of the porous medium and the target substance. It was shown by column experiments with quartz sand that the appearance of oscillations can be controlled by using different mixing vessel solute volumes. The breakthrough data obtained within these experiments was then used to validate a numerical model that was derived by coupling the numerical solution of a transport equation with the model describing the mixing vessel in a loop. This model was used for a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to illustrate the response of the breakthrough curve to changes in the dispersion and the parameters describing adsorption with respect to strength, rate and nonlinearity. Each process thereby produced unique responses that confirm the high information content of closed-flow breakthrough data, which has shown to intrinsically contain information on the water content and the pumping rate as well. Finally, a numerical analysis of inverse parameter determination revealed a massive decrease in parameter uncertainty under optimal conditions, which renders the approach also highly relevant for practical applications.",

Areas underlain by permafrost store high amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). Permafrost disturbances may contribute to increased release of carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere.

Large expanses of permafrost affected land are characterised by intense mass-wasting processes such as solifluction, active-layer detachments and retrogressive thaw slumping. Our aim is to assess the influence of mass wasting on SOC storage and coastal erosion. We studied SOC storage on Herschel Island by analysing active-layer and permafrost samples, and compared non-disturbed sites to those characterised by mass wasting.

Such acclimatisation processes require refined sensitive mechanisms, including a variety of different light sensing photoreceptors (Smith, 1982; Montgomery and Lagarias, 2002). Phytochromes are the most important photoreceptors in plants regulating several essential developmental changes like seed germination and de-etiolation as well as stem elongation (Figure 1.1). However, the two major phytochromes phyA and phyB exhibit dramatic differences in their action spectra for physiological responses, with phyB being most active in red light and phyA in far red light (Casal et al., 1998). These differences cannot be explained by the photo-physical properties of the phytochromes, because these are virtually identical for all phytochromes (Eichenberg et al., 2000)",

            "The present work investigates the responses of plants to abiotic environmental conditions and their effects on ecosystem properties. It builds on the notion of the effect-response framework. Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania served as a model system, where plant functional traits of the most abundant and widespread species were collected. The main part of this dissertation consists of three chapters to be published as research articles. The first of the main chapters investigates the niche breadths of plant species along environmental gradients and addresses the question whether plant functional traits can predict corresponding niche optima. The second study deals with the variance of trait values within and between plant communities in relation to environmental conditions. In the third main chapter, it is investigated whether plant functional traits, the abiotic environment, or both combined influence mean animal body mass in taxonomically defined groups or feeding guilds. <engl.>",

            "Next to the advantages, in Bobbin Tool Friction Stir Welding (BT-FSW) the excessive heat generated by both shoulders leads to an excessive degradation of the joint microstructure and a consequent loss in mechanical properties. During this work a new set of welding tools and a new unique experimental BT-FSW system was created. An analytical model was introduced, which identified the kinetic energy on the retreating side of the weld zone as a critical value in the modelling to indicate the experimental feasibility. The Semi-Stationary Bobbin Tool (S3BT) process variant has shown good results in reducing handling forces in combination with considerable high welding speeds of 3000 mm/min and low energy inputs. The adaption of the tool concept to articulated arm robots appears realistic.",

        "abstract": "In this thesis we study reciprocal classes of Markov chains. Given a continuous time Markov chain on a countable state space, acting as reference dynamics, the associated reciprocal class is the set of all probability measures on path space that can be written as a mixture of its bridges. These processes possess a conditional independence property that generalizes the Markov property, and evolved from an idea of Schrödinger, who wanted to obtain a probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics. Associated to a reciprocal class is a set of reciprocal characteristics, which are space-time functions that determine the reciprocal class. We compute explicitly these characteristics, and divide them into two main families: arc characteristics and cycle characteristics. As a byproduct, we obtain an explicit criterion to check when two different Markov chains share their bridges. Starting from the characteristics we offer two different descriptions of the reciprocal class, including its non-Markov probabilities. The first one is based on a pathwise approach and the second one on short time asymptotic. With the first approach one produces a family of functional equations whose only solutions are precisely the elements of the reciprocal class. These equations are integration by parts on path space associated with derivative operators which perturb the paths by mean of the addition of random loops. Several geometrical tools are employed to construct such formulas. The problem of obtaining sharp characterizations is also considered, showing some interesting connections with discrete geometry. Examples of such formulas are given in the framework of counting processes and random walks on Abelian groups, where the set of loops has a group structure. In addition to this global description, we propose a second approach by looking at the short time behavior of a reciprocal process. In the same way as the Markov property and short time expansions of transition probabilities characterize Markov chains, we show that a reciprocal class is characterized by imposing the reciprocal property and two families of short time expansions for the bridges. Such local approach is suitable to study reciprocal processes on general countable graphs. As application of our characterization, we considered several interesting graphs, such as lattices, planar graphs, the complete graph, and the hypercube. Finally, we obtain some first results about concentration of measure implied by lower bounds on the reciprocal characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: This thesis was conducted to describe the role of TGFβ mediated regulation of microglia homeostasis and activation. To this aim, I generated and characterised microglia-specific knockout mouse lines to analyse the importance of R-SMAD-dependent (mgTgfbr2-/-) and Co-SMAD-dependent (mgSmad4-/-) TGFβ signalling in microglia. Moreover, microglia-specific deletion of Tgfb1 (mgTgfb1-/-) was induced to address the effects of microglia-derived TGFβ1. According to the current literature, this is the first study using mouse lines with microglia-specific knockout of TGFβ signalling molecules.I could show that the generated mouse lines are valid models for the microglia-specific analysis of TGFβ signalling, as demonstrated by deletion on genomic and protein levels. Importantly, functional impairment of TGFβ signalling could be detected in vitro and in vivo. The knockout mice were used to reveal that microglial TGFβ signalling is not essential for microglia survival and maintenance, as no differences were seen in microglia cell numbers in vivo. Elevated cell numbers in vitro indicated an increased proliferative activity of mgTgfbr2-/- microglia. Furthermore, mice did not show any phenotypic differences with regard to body weight or survival. Additionally, using mgSmad4-/- mice, I could show that the expression of distinct TGFβ-induced genes was dependent on SMAD4. Interestingly, TGFβ-driven nuclear translocation of R-SMADs in microglia was independent on SMAD4.I could show that knockout of microglial Tgfbr2, but not of Smad4 or Tgfb1, led to an activated microglia phenotype under physiological conditions as reflected by increased expression activation markers CD86, CD206, CD36 and MHCII. mgTgfbr2-/- microglia also showed an increase of TAK1 phosphorylation as well as CCL2 and CXCL10 secretion. In contrast, knockout of Smad4 only led to a moderate increase of TAK1 phosphorylation and secretion of CCL3 and CCL4 in vitro. I could therefore show that the effects mgTgfbr2 and mgSmad4 knockout resulted in different outcome, indicating a major role of R-SMAD-dependent signalling in the regulation of microglia activation under physiological conditions. However, distinct and partially non-overlapping effects were detected in mgSmad4-/- microglia, indicating a contribution of Co-SMAD-dependent signalling for microglia quiescence. Exogenous TGFβ1 was no longer able to attenuate IFNγ-induced upregulation of the activation markers iNos and Tnfa in Tgfbr2 ...",

        "abstract": "We study segregation of the subducted oceanic crust (OC) at the core mantle boundary and its ability to accumulate and form large thermochemical piles (such as the seismically observed Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces - LLSVPs). Our high-resolution numerical simulations suggest that the longevity of LLSVPs for up to three billion years, and possibly longer, can be ensured by a balance in the rate of segregation of high-density OC-material to the CMB, and the rate of its entrainment away from the CMB by mantle upwellings. For a range of parameters tested in this study, a large-scale compositional anomaly forms at the CMB, similar in shape and size to the LLSVPs. Neutrally buoyant thermochemical piles formed by mechanical stirring - where thermally induced negative density anomaly is balanced by the presence of a fraction of dense anomalous material - best resemble the geometry of LLSVPs. Such neutrally buoyant piles tend to emerge and survive for at least 3Gyr in simulations with quite different parameters. We conclude that for a plausible range of values of density anomaly of OC material in the lower mantle - it is likely that it segregates to the CMB, gets mechanically mixed with the ambient material, and forms neutrally buoyant large scale compositional anomalies similar in shape to the LLSVPs. We have developed an efficient FEM code with dynamically adaptive time and space resolution, and marker-in-cell methodology. This enabled us to model thermochemical mantle convection at realistically high convective vigor, strong thermally induced viscosity variations, and long term evolution of compositional fields.",

        "abstract": "The main focus of the present thesis was to investigate the stabilization ability of poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs) in several examples as well as develop novel chemical structures and synthetic routes of PILs. The performed research can be specifically divided into three parts that include synthesis and application of hybrid material composed of PIL and cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), thiazolium-containing PILs, and main-chain imidazolium-type PILs. In the first chapter, a vinylimidazolium-type IL was polymerized in water in the presence of CNFs resulting in the in situ electrostatic grafting of polymeric chains onto the surface of CNFs. The synthesized hybrid material merged advantages of its two components, that is, superior mechanical strength of CNFs and anion dependent solution properties of PILs. In contrast to unmodified CNFs, the hybrid could be stabilized and processed in organic solvents enabling its application as reinforcing agent for porous polyelectrolyte membranes. In the second part, PILs and ionic polymers containing two types of thiazolium repeating units were synthesized. Such polymers displayed counterion dependent thermal stability and solubility in organic solvents of various dielectric constants. This new class of PILs was tested as stabilizers and phase transfer agents for carbon nanotubes in aqueous and organic media, and as binder materials to disperse electroactive powders and carbon additives in solid electrode in lithium-ion batteries. The incorporation of S and N atoms into the polymeric structures make such PILs also potential precursors for S, N - co-doped carbons. In the last chapter, reactants originating from biomass were successfully harnessed to synthesize main-chain imidazolium-type PILs. An imidazolium-type diester IL obtained via a modified Debus-Radziszewski reaction underwent transesterification with diol in a polycondensation reaction. This yielded a polyester-type PIL which CO2 sorption properties were investigated. In the next step, the modified Debus-Radziszewski reaction was further applied to synthesize main-chain PILs according to a convenient, one-step protocol, using water as a green solvent and simple organic molecules as reagents. Depending on the structure of the employed diamine, the synthesized PILs after anion exchange showed superior thermal stability with unusually high carbonization yields. Overall, the outcome of these studies will actively contribute to the current research on PILs by introducing novel PIL chemical structures, improved synthetic routes, and new examples of stabilized materials. The synthesis of main-chain imidazolium-type PILs by a modified Debus-Radziszewski reaction is of a special interest for the future work on porous ionic liquid networks as well as colloidal PIL nanoparticles.",

Compared to conventional culture based methods, nucleic acid analysis provides an obvious benefit in specificity and reduction in time-to-result. In time-critical situations and in settings where access to centralized labora-tories for sample analysis is limited, nucleic acid analysis, conducted directly at the “point-of-care” would be desired. However, the complex workflow for analysis, typically comprising cell lysis, nucleic acid purification, amplification and detection, hinders the automation in portable systems and consequently only few point-of-care systems are available.Aim of this thesis was the development of a centrifugal microfluidic cartridge for nucleic acid analysis that potentially could be operated at the point-of-care. To achieve this goal, several sub-goals including the development of a process chains for nucleic acid extraction and for multiplex nucleic acid amplification were defined. These process chains were finally co-integrated on one cartridge for sample-to-answer nucleic acid analysis.Initially, a unit operation for transportation of magnetic beads between several microfluidic chambers was developed. Here, bead transport was solely depending on the azimuthal position of the cartridge with respect to a locally fixed, external permanent magnet, ‘transport magnet’. This implementation allowed an isoradial arrangement of the microfluidic chambers thereby circumventing one of the basic limitations for integration of complex assays on the centrifugal microfluidic cartridge: the arrangement of consequtive assay steps in radial direction from the cartridge center towards the rim. Yield of bead transport through three microfluidic chambers was measured to 82.6 % ± 3.6 %. With this unit operation, DNA from Listeria innocua lysates and lambda phages was purified with recoveries of up to 68 % ± 24 % and 43 % ± 10 %, respectively, compared to manual reference. The unit-operation was then completed by a second external permanent magnet, ‘collection magnet’, to collect beads in liquid volumes as large as 1 mL before they are transported out of the liquid into the adjacent microfluidic chamber  ...",

Konventionellen, kulturbasierten Verfahren ist die Nukleinsäureanalytik vor allem durch eine höhere Spezifizität und eine geringere Analysezeit überlegen. Für zeitkritische Fragestellungen und in Umgebungen, in denen kein Zugang zu einer zentrallabor-basierten Diagnostik besteht, wäre eine Durchführung der Analyse am sogenannten Point-of-Care wünschenswert. Die Vielzahl der erforderlichen Einzelschritten wie Zelllyse, Nukleinsäureaufreinigung, Amplifikation und Detektion, erschwert jedoch eine Automatisierung der Analyse erheblich. Aus diesem Grund sind erst wenige Point-of-Care Systeme am Markt verfügbar. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war die Entwicklung einer zentrifugal-mikrofluidischen Kartusche für die Nukleinsäureanalytik die potentiell am Point-of-Care eingesetzt werden kann. Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen wurden mehrere Teilziele einschließlich der Entwicklung von zentrifugal-mikrofluidischen Prozessketten zur Nukleinsäureextraktion und Amplifikation definiert. Anschließend wurden die entwickelten Prozessketten gemeinsam in eine Kartusche integriert um den vollständigen Ablauf der Analyse von der Probenaufgabe bis zum Ergebnis automatisiert abzubilden.

        "abstract": "Sample supervised search centric image segmentation denotes a general method where quality segments are generated based on the provision of a selection of reference segments. The main purpose of such a method is to correctly segment a multitude of identical elements in an image based on these reference segments. An efficient search algorithm traverses the parameter space of a given segmentation algorithm. A supervised quality measure guides the search for the best segmentation results, or rather the best performing parameter set. This method, which is academically pursued in the context of remote sensing and elsewhere, shows promise in assisting the generation of earth observation information products. The method may find applications specifically within the context of user driven geographic object-based image analysis approaches, mainly in respect of very high resolution optical data. Rapid mapping activities as well as general land-cover mapping or targeted element identification may benefit from such a method. In this work it is suggested that sample supervised search centric geographic segment generation forms the basis of a set of methods, or rather a methodological avenue. The original formulation of the method, although promising, is limited in the quality of the segments it can produce – it is still limited by the inherent capability of the given segmentation algorithm. From an optimisation viewpoint, various structures may be encoded forming the fitness or search landscape traversed by a given search algorithm. These structures may interact or have an interplay with the given segmentation algorithm. Various method variants considering expanded fitness landscapes are possible. Additional processes, or constituents, such as data mapping, classification and post-segmentation heuristics may be embedded into such a method. Three distinct and novel method variants are proposed and evaluated based on this concept of expanded fitness landscapes.",

        "abstract": "Zusammenfassung: The occurrence of the sweet chestnut in the form of grown coppices in the foothill zone of the Vosges, the Palatine woods and the Black Forest is due to a long winegrowing tradition in the Upper Rhine region. During the principal winegrowing period, sweet chestnut coppices delivered high quality vineyard poles and were an indispensable source of wood and nourishment for rural populations. In the last decades however, forests have gradually lost their significance as a production site for society at large. This tendency is also reflected by the sweet chestnut forest stands. The existing coppice stands were either converted into timber producing forests or abandoned. The once graded transition from the open land to timber forests, which was originally created by sweet chestnut coppice stands along the timber line, was slowly transformed into simply structured farm land alongside timber forests characterized by viniculture.This thesis is part of the EU-funded project „The sweet chestnut in the Upper Rhine region – A tree species which connects people, cultures and landscapes“. The research tasks of the Chair of Landscape Management were to determine the touristic and sociocultural impact of this tree species. In particular, the objective of the thesis was to investigate the aesthetic importance of the sweet chestnut in the Upper Rhine region. The studies intended to demonstrate why traditional cultivation methods of the sweet chestnut should be preserved, especially in consideration of the ever increasing homogenization of the landscape. To answer this research question, it was first necessary to develop a suitable procedure for evaluating the aesthetic impact of specific tree species on the landscape. The challenge of this thesis was to approachthe simple, yet by its nature strongly subjective question regarding the „beauty“ of specific tree species in the landscape from an application-oriented perspective (i.e., as objectively as possible).Starting from various methods of image-based landscape assessment and empirical social research, analytical steps specifically tailored to the research question were developed. These steps made it possible to approach the problem from both a userdependent as well as a user-independent point of view. Combining several methods of landscape assessment in order to gradually analyze the impact of the sweet chestnut, or any other specific tree species on a given part of the landscape, allowed taking i ...",

        "abstract": "Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. It is a global problem that has to be understood in the context of a globalising world with an increasing amount of goods being traded. This dissertation focuses on the interrelation between international trade and climate policies. It contributes to the literature from two perspectives: a demand side view by means of theoretical modelling, and a supply side view using numerical simulation. The first part of this dissertation uses general equilibrium trade models to analyse the effect of trade liberalisation on the environment. It shows that a trade-induced reallocation of production factors towards the most productive firms can explain part of sector-level changes in emission intensities. Moreover, if environmental policy is used strategically to substitute for trade policy, general equilibrium effects on firms’ markups need to be considered. The findings highlight that firm behaviour, factor reallocation across firms, and market structure all play a vital role for the impact of trade on the environment. The second part of this dissertation turns to the supply side of fossil fuels—the major source of greenhouse gas emissions. It shows that fossil fuels are globally abundant despite uncertainties in local supply, for instance of unconventional natural gas. It is hence not a physical scarcity that solves the problem of climate change. Accordingly, climate policy has to target the use of fossil fuels. While the use of natural gas may be consistent with the transformation towards a low carbon energy system, the phase-out of coal is integral for climate change mitigation. By means of numerical simulations, the relation between climate policy and the international trade in natural gas and steam coal is investigated. Moreover, this dissertation analyses to what extent major steam coal exporters have a self-interest in restricting their supply.",

            "Femto-BSs, also known as home evolved NodeB (HeNB), are low-power and small scale BSs that are deployed within traditional macro-cellular networks. With these so-called small cells, the spatial reuse of radio resources is tremendously boosted, wall penetration losses are largely mitigated, and users can enjoy high data rates. In addition to its various advantages, the deployment of femtocells also comes with some problems and one of the main issues is the increase in interference. The interference mitigation in femtocell networks is the main aim of this thesis. In order to achieve this goal, the characteristics and interference environment of femtocell deployments have been investigated, and the properties of interference mitigation techniques applicable to such networks are studied. To this end, dynamic central and distributed resource assignment methods have been developed where network can update itself depending on the changes in the interference environment. Furthermore, the application of the developed techniques in real network deployments such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and Long-Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) have been studied. Although the focus is on femtocell networks, the developed methods in this thesis can be applied to any wireless networks with minor changes.$cen$dAbstract",
            "Femtobasisstationen, die auch als Home Evolved NodeB bekannt sind, sind kleine Basisstationen mit niedriger Sendeleistung, welche innerhalb des traditionellen Makronetzwerkes eingesetzt werden. Mit diesen Kleinzellen wird die räumliche Wiederverwendung der Übertragungsressourcen enorm gesteigert, Wanddurchdringungsverluste stark abgeschwächt und höhere Datenraten erreicht. Allerdings erzeugen Femtobasisstationen auch Herausforderungen und die größte Herausforderung ist dabei die gesteigerte Interferenz. Die Abschwächung von Interferenz in Femtobasisstationsnetzwerken ist das Ziel dieser Arbeit. Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, wurden die Charakteristiken und die Interferenzumgebung von Femtozellen erforscht und die Eigenschaften von für solche Netze geeigneten Interferenzschwächungstechniken studiert. Daher wurden dynamische Methoden zur zentralen und zur verteilten Ressourcenverteilung entwickelt, durch welche sich das Netzwerk selbstständig aktualisieren kann, abhängig von der Interferenzsituation. Zusätzlich wurden die vorgeschlagenen Techniken in aktuellen Standards wie Long-Term Evolution (LTE) und Long-Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) getestet. Obwohl der Fokus hier auf Femtonetzwerken liegt, können die entwickelten Methoden mit kleinen Anpassungen auch in anderen Drahtlosnetzwerken eingesetzt werden.$cde$dAbstract"

        "abstract": "Making the interaction of human subjects with technical systems more intuitive is a quickly emerging interdisciplinary field of research. One important aspect of this field is the surveillance of the user by the respective system and thus enabling it to estimate distinct user states. The automatic recognition of user states in human-computer interaction poses a great challenge to statistical pattern recognition for several reasons: The measurements of the different sensors are inherently heterogeneous in their technical properties, for example considering sample rates, range of values or resolution. Another important aspect is the fact that the true state of a subject is generally not entirely observable from the outside, which makes the design of corpora that study human-computer interaction extremely difficult. This leads in many cases to weakly or subjectively defined class labels by either using human test persons that annotate the collected material manually or by using externally triggered stimuli that are designed to elicit distinct predefined states. In order to approach the recognition of user states in human-computer interaction, the multi-modal and the temporal properties of the application are exploited in this work. For this purpose, different information fusion architectures based on multiple classifier system approaches and temporal integration techniques are introduced and discussed. Besides this, the incorporation of unlabeled data into the training of the classifier is a compelling issue since one is generally short of training data as described earlier. This work will introduce a partially supervised learning approach, that combines unsupervised and supervised learning in order to extend the amount of usable data. Finally, the problem of imbalanced class distributions is tackled by a class weighting mechanism in the training of support vector machines, which increases the loss for the underrepresented class.",

        "abstract": "... In this work we focus on the stream-based learning, since it has several advantages over the conventional, batch-based learning. One of the advantage is the ability to immediately incorporate new information into a preference model without relearning the entire model. This is an essential feature for real-life recommender systems, as their application scenarios are highly dynamic. Therefore, new information typically appears at a high rate. - Our first type are forgetting methods for stream-based recommender systems. Selecting what information to forget is equivalent to selecting which information to learn from. We propose eleven different forgetting strategies that select the obsolete information to be forgotten and three different algorithms that enforce forgetting on a stream of ratings. We stress that obsolete information is not necessarily old. Next to incorporating new information into a preference model, our forgetting techniques are the second way of adapting to concept drift or shift. - In our second type of selective learning we introduce selective neighbourhood for collaborative filtering methods. It encompasses a novel selection criterion based on the Hoeffding Bound for removing unreliable users from a neighbourhood. Our criterion considers both, the number of common ratings between users and the value of their similarity. - Our last selective approach is based on semi-supervised learning (SSL) for stream-based recommender systems. In this approach a recommender system exploits the abundant unlabelled information (user-item-pairs without ratings), which, typically, reaches 99% of all information. - To exploit this information for training of preference models we propose the first stream-based semi-supervised recommendation framework. In semi-supervised learning, predictions are used as labels. However, not all predictions are equally reliable. We propose components that selectively and incrementally estimate reliability of predictions and filter out the unreliable ones. Only highly reliable predictions are used for training in one of two SSL approaches: cotraining and self-learning. ...",

        "abstract": "There are in general three approaches to propagate partially coherent light. They include solving the Helmholtz equations for the correlation function, employing the Wigner function to propagate light in phase space, or using modal expansion. In this work, we investigate the interaction of partially spatially coherent light with optical systems. Our modeling methods are based on the Wigner function and modal expansion.  First, we utilize the thin element approximation in the Wigner function to propagate partially coherent light through discontinuous surfaces. Our examples include the phase step, grating, kinoform lens, axicon and lens array. Phase space provides a vivid picture for understanding the diffraction effects, e.g. the diffracted orders formed by a grating, the multiple foci of a kinoform lens, and the beam homogenizing effect of a lens array, etc. This approach facilitates the design of diffractive elements and the interpretation of optical effects. Second, we improve the propagation algorithms for the Wigner function. These implementations include removing a parabolic wavefront of a beam, and an efficient propagator based on rotating the phase space. Both algorithms increase the computational speed without losing any physical accuracy. To overcome certain limitations of our phase space propagators, we investigate the modal expansion method. We use Schell beams as examples, to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of eigenmode and shifted-elementary mode expansions. Afterward, we develop an expansion tool to efficiently propagate partially coherent light inside waveguides. This tool allows quick access to the light fields at any distance inside the waveguide. We thus obtain an accurate modeling of the diffraction effects produced by the waveguide structure. Our modeling methods pave the path to the experimental measurement of coherence. We discuss two schemes to retrieve the spatial coherence of a beam under test. The first scheme is to solve an inverse problem of the modal expansion. It requires iterative phase retrieval algorithms to recover the complex fields of individual modes. We extend this method to a beam with an arbitrary wavefront and discuss the potential and limits of this technique. The second scheme for coherence retrieval is to solve the inverse problem of the Wigner function, also known as the phase space tomography. To reconstruct a Wigner function requires an inverse Radon transform in a four-dimensional space. We present an overview of the two relevant algorithms, i.e. the filtered back projection and the ambiguity function reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose an improved algorithm for the filtered back projection.",

Advances in camera, laser and computation technologies have enabled an ever-increasing number of imaging technologies. Imaging with visible and infrared light has the advantage that it is less harmful than other radiation and its wavelength is in the order of magnitude of cells and subcellular components. Fluorescence microscopy provides good chemical contrast and multi-colour imaging can help elucidate cellular architecture. Incoherent superresolution methods permit us to bypass Abbe's diffraction limit of lateral resolution and visualize previously unnoticed details. Coherent imaging methods such as optical coherence tomography or holoscopy do not require any previous labelling and have the advantage that they record both the amplitude and phase of the light emitted from a scattering sample by interferometric superposition with a reference wave. Both incoherent an coherent imaging methods are used in this thesis. The results of two interdisciplinary research collaborations using different fluorescence microscopy methods, including superresolution methods, are presented. Podosomes in macrophages were studied with stimulated emission depletion microscopy, structured illumination microscopy and localisation microscopy and a distinctly polygonal shape in their vinculin rings was found. Image processing routines allowed for a quantitative analysis of the acquired images [1]. In the second study, chlorophyll, the most prominent natural pigments, and digested chlorophyll metabolites were detected in gut section of the herbivorous Spodoptera littoralis larva. Widefield and high-resolution autofluorescence microscopy revealed that the brush border membranes of their gut are covered with the chlorophyllide binding protein tightly bound to the gut membrane. A function in defense against gut microbes is discussed [2]. ...",

        "abstract": "Bank filtration is an effective water treatment technique and is widely adopted in Europe along major rivers. It is the process where surface water penetrates the riverbed, flows through the aquifer, and then is extracted by near-bank production wells. By flowing in the subsurface flow passage, the water quality can be improved by a series of beneficial processes. Long-term riverbank filtration also produces colmation layers on the riverbed. The colmation layer may act as a bioactive zone that is governed by biochemical and physical processes owing to its enrichment of microbes and organic matter. Low permeability may strongly limit the surface water infiltration and further lead to a decreasing recoverable ratio of production wells.The removal of the colmation layer is therefore a trade-off between the treatment capacity and treatment efficiency.

Feeding experiments with isotope-labeled glucose led to the discovery of its possible metabolic product herpetopanone. In addition, chemical analysis allowed the discovery of five known products from Herpetosiphon spp. including two diketopiperazines, futalosine and its derivative, as well as N-acetyl-tryptophan. In order to increase species richness and reveal metabolic diverse of the genus Herpetosiphon, three unclassified Herpetosiphon spp. and a Herpetosiphon giganteus bacterium from DSMZ were subjected to a phylogenetic analysis. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data it was concluded that Herpetosiphon sp. Hp g472 represents a novel species of the genus Herpetosiphon. In addition, an emended description of H. giganteus was proposed in this study. All bacteria in the genus Herpetosiphon are capable of predation. Genome mining of Herpetosiphon spp. revealed that they harbor a high number of biosynthetic gene clusters. Up to now, three new compounds were reported from the type species H. aurantiacus DSM 785, but the genomic potential for natural product biosynthesis is much larger.

        "abstract": "A comprehensive description and comparison of present market dissolving wood pulps (DWP) is provided. The systematic difference between kraft and sulfite pulps destined for the same application could be shown. Alkalization or alkaline extraction is the most common process operation when using DWP. A method to determine the degree of conversion to alkali cellulose as a result of alkalization based on Raman spectroscopy was developed. Extraction with 18 wt% aq. NaOH gave for all DWP investigated optimal alkalization results regarding yield, purity, and transformation. The choice of steeping temperature was found to be important in order to balance yield and purity of xylan-containing pulps. DWP is usually dried prior to application. Never-dried pulp is supposed to have a better processability due to less hornification. The structural changes induced by drying performed with differing severity as it might occur due to variations in the drying machine were investigated. The determination of the water retention value gave the most consistent results. Evaluations using solid-state NMR and size exclusion chromatography could support the findings. An application study when carboxymethylating alkalized paper and dissolving wood pulp with extreme variation in hemicellulose content, intrinsic viscosity, content of extractives and content of cellulose II found that favorable process conditions using 15 wt% aq. NaOH turn all pulps used into well soluble carboxymethylated cellulose (CMC) with a high degree of substitution (DS). A DS near to the limit for water solubility was obtained when CMC was prepared in the presence of 5 wt% aq. NaOH and gave the possibility to rank different pulps in terms of their solubility. None of the various measured chemical and supramolecular properties could clearly explain the differences between the used DWP which suggests further investigations on the reason for the different applicability of pulps.",

            "In this work, studies with respect to the exhaust problem were performed in the stellarator experiment Wendelstein 7-X with different target concepts and different magnetic field geometries. Different infrared cameras were used to study the heat flux from the plasma onto the PFC. In the first publication, the limiter set-up was used with a simpler magnetic topology in the plasma edge. The radial fall-off of the parallel heat flux for inboard limiters in W7-X shows, similar to inboard limiters in tokamaks, two different radial fall-off lengths, a short (narrow) one, characterizing the near-SOL, and a long (broad) characterizing the far-SOL. For the far-SOL, the heating power and connection length have been identified as the main scaling parameters, while for the near-SOL, the electron temperature close to the LCFS has been identified as the main scaling parameter. The two fall-off lengths differ by a factor 10, and the found scalings for both regimes differ from known models and experimental scalings in tokamaks. A turbulent-driven feature was discussed in the publication as a possible explanation for the behavior of the fall-off length in W7-X. The gained information and data have been further used to support many other publications, covering the symmetry of the heat loads, the energy balance of the machine, and seeding experiments.

            "This thesis provides the first comprehensive theoretical overview of the electronic and optical properties of two dimensional (2D) Indium Selenide: atomically thin films of InSe ranging from monolayers to few layers in thickness. The thesis shows how the electronic propertes of 2D InSe vary significantly with film thickness, changing from a weakly indirect semiconductor for the monolayer to a direct gap material in the bulk form, with a strong band gap variation with film thickness predicted and recently observed in optical experiments. The proposed theory is based on a specially designed hybrid k.p tight-binding model approach (HkpTB), which uses an intralayer k.p Hamiltonian to describe the InSe monolayer, and tight-binding-like interlayer hopping. Electronic and optical absorption spectra are determined, and a detailed description of subbands of electrons in few-layer films and the influence of spin-orbit coupling is provided. The author shows that the principal optical excitations of InSe films with the thickness from 1 to 15 layers broadly cover the visible spectrum, with the possibility of extending optical functionality into the infrared and THz range using intersubband transitions",

Since then the local government aimed to supply a planning approach that is of an integrative nature, opposed to the disintegrative one during Apartheid before 1994. South Africa's primary instrument for development is named the Integrated Development Plan (IDP). This instrument is primarily responsible for socioeconomic development but significantly affects and considers spatial planning aspects as well. Between 1999 and 2001 the five selected project cases along the Ingulube Drive in Nyanga and Philippi under the umbrella of the Dignified Places rogramme have been implemented. The study analysis aims to investigate a specific momentum in time, where spatial practice in South Africa began to experience a new, integrative approach.

            "This work focuses on 'statistical cocktail party processing': localization, tracking, and enhancement of voices in concurrent speech or in high levels of nonstationary noise. Key strategies are to link binaural and spectro-temporal information, to combine cues across frequency and time by a probabilistic approach, and to treat speech as a multidimensional stochastic signal, using a priori knowledge about it. To implement these, Bayesian estimation, sequential Monte Carlo methods, and statistical evaluation of speech databases are used. Three on-line algorithms are developed and tested, which run partly in real-time. They allow for a robust, efficient and exact sound localization even at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and successful tracking and separation of voices with convergence times between 50 and 200 ms. The multidimensional statistical approach allows to analyze acoustical scenes at low SNR, showing that the described strategies might help to interpret auditory processing. <engl.>",

        "abstract": "Data integration provides a unified view of data by combining different data sources. In today’s multi-disciplinary and collaborative research environments, data is often produced and consumed by various means, multiple researchers operate on the data in different divisions to satisfy various research requirements, and using different query processors and analysis tools. This makes data integration a crucial component of any successful data intensive research activity. The fundamental difficulty is that data is heterogeneous not only in syntax, structure, and semantics, but also in the way it is accessed and queried. We introduce QUIS (QUery In-Situ), an agile query system equipped with a unified query language and a federated execution engine. It is capable of running queries on heterogeneous data sources in an in-situ manner. Its language provides advanced features such as virtual schemas, heterogeneous joins, and polymorphic result set representation. QUIS utilizes a federation of agents to transform a given input query written in its language to a (set of) computation models that are executable on the designated data sources. Federative query virtualization has the disadvantage that some aspects of a query may not be supported by the designated data sources. QUIS ensures that input queries are always fully satisfied. Therefore, if the target data sources do not fulfill all of the query requirements, QUIS detects the features that are lacking and complements them in a transparent manner. QUIS provides union and join capabilities over an unbound list of heterogeneous data sources; in addition, it offers solutions for heterogeneous query planning and optimization. In brief, QUIS is intended to mitigate data access heterogeneity through query virtualization, on-the-fly transformation, and federated execution. It offers in-Situ querying, agile querying, heterogeneous data source querying, unifeied execution, late-bound virtual schemas, and Remote execution.",

Earthquake microzonation maps were developed to describe such site effects.  A qualitative earthquake microzonation map of greater Lörrach, an urban area in Germany, was developed during this study, to describe relative attenuation (deamplification) and amplification of near-surface seismic waves in the investigation area.

            "In this thesis, it is the great interest that artists, along with their audiences, took in the designing of their living and working environment in the 19th century that serves as a starting point. More specifically, I examine the significance of artistic engagement with the house in the period around 1860, a field proving to be particularly productive, especially in England: in an era of bourgeois prosperity and self-esteem, the house was in vogue and, consequently, was deliberately constructed as an interior. But in which regard do the strategies used to appropriate houses relate to this artistically? To what extent can it be said that the inhabitants likewise based their self-conception on such strategies? With the examples of the cottage of the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron (1815-79) on the Isle of Wight, and the London studio house of the painter Frederic Leighton (1830-96), I present two contemporaneous forms of reference in which highly different artistic concepts can be observed. In both cases, it was the house that allowed the respective artists to “establish” themselves extensively comprehensively.",

Jahrhundert der Gestaltung ihres Wohn- und Arbeitsumfeldes entgegenbrachten zum Ausgangspunkt meiner Untersuchung.

Doch wie verhalten sich dazu die Strategien, mit denen sich Künstlerinnen und Künstler ihre Häuser aneigneten? Inwiefern lässt sich sagen, dass die Bewohner sich anhand dieser Strategien selbst entwarfen? Am Beispiel des zum Studio umgebauten Cottage der Photographin Julia Margaret Cameron (1815–79) auf der Isle of Wight, sowie des Londoner Atelierhauses des Malers Frederic Leighton (1830–96) stelle ich zwei zeitgleiche Bezugsformen dar, an denen sich höchst verschiedene künstlerische Konzepte beobachten lassen.

        "abstract": "The Central Pacific area of Costa Rica is a convergent erosional margin, characterized by a high seismicity rate, coincident with the subduction of rough-relief ocean floor. It has generated earthquakes with magnitude up to seven in the past along the subduction megathrust and the inner-forearc faulting. This study uses the records from a temporal seismological network, consisting of on- and offshore stations, installed for a period of six months in this segment of the Middle American margin. The aim was to obtain a model of the 3-D velocity structure of the margin and to characterize the seismicity of the shallow part (< 70 km depth) of the subduction zone, with the focus on the seismogenic zone. A subset of well locatable events was selected to calculate a minimum 1-D model for the P-wave velocity. This model served as initial reference model for the subsequent 3-D inversion in a Local Earthquake Tomography, performed by inverting P- and S-wave traveltimes from 595 selected earthquakes. Several tools for resolution assessment were applied. Additionally, first-motion, double-couple focal mechanisms were determined for earthquakes originated at the plate interface, the subducting slab and the overriding plate. The results reflect the complexity associated to subduction of ocean-floor morphology and the transition from normal to thickened subducting oceanic crust...",

Finally, Wess-Zumino models in the continuum and on spatial lattices, which result in high dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems, are discussed in detail.

        "abstract": "Fluids in the Earth's crust can move by creating and flowing through fractures, in a process called `hydraulic fracturing’. The tip-line of such fluid-filled fractures grows at locations where stress is larger than the strength of the rock. Where the tip stress vanishes, the fracture closes and the fluid-front retreats. If stress gradients exist on the fracture's walls, induced by fluid/rock density contrasts or topographic stresses, this results in an asymmetric shape and growth of the fracture, allowing for the contained batch of fluid to propagate through the crust. The state-of-the-art analytical and numerical methods to simulate fluid-filled fracture propagation are two-dimensional (2D). In this work I extend these to three dimensions (3D). In my analytical method, I approximate the propagating 3D fracture as a penny-shaped crack that is influenced by both an internal pressure and stress gradients. In addition, I develop a numerical method to model propagation where curved fractures can be simulated as a mesh of triangular ...",

The inducibility of poly-P synthesis in the uppermost sediment layers and stimulation of growth of Poly-P accumulating bacteria (PAO) were studied in laboratory experiments. A high bacterial diversity was found in all studied samples but no significant correlations occurred between poly-P contents and the presence of specific microbial groups. Since analysis of microbial communities using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and FISH did not reveal PAO in the poly-P rich lake sediments a laser microdissection method has been established for the separation of poly-P positive bacterial cells (visualized by DAPI staining under a fluorescence microscope) from lake sediment and activated sludge samples.

One major objective of this thesis was to test whether cardenolides in the seeds of Asclepias curassavica defend against the specialist seed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. For this, ten compounds were isolated from A. curassavica seeds, three of those new and seven previously reported. Glucopyranosyl frugoside is the most abundant cardenolide in this tissue, and there was a significant variation in the compounds’ inhibition of the unadapted Na+/K+—ATPase. To test whether the variability in cardenolides in the seeds could represent the plant's response to selection by O. fasciatus; cardenolide analysis of the seeds and O. fasciatus was combined with tests of the inhibitory capacity of a subset of compounds against of O. fasciatus and a non-adapted insect target sites. Frugoside and gofruside were more concentrated in the bugs than is available in their diet and had contrasting potency toward the O. fasciatus target site. Thus, the accumulation of these compounds could not be explained by their availability in seeds or the biological activity on the bug’s target site. To test an alternative hypothesis that the plant chemodiversity and sequestration patterns of O. fasciatus are explained by natural selection by the third trophic level. The inhibitory properties of cardenolides in O. fasciatus were tested against several predator target sites. Glucopyranosyl frugoside and frugoside were toxic for both resistant and sensitive predators, whereas gofruside had varying degrees of inhibitory capacity. This differential effect suggests that predators can contribute to defence diversification in both milkweed plants and milkweed herbivores.",

            "The growing market of building integrated photovoltaic applications and projects increases the demand for versatile and novel photovoltaic modules. Thin-film silicon solar cells have a significant advantage over other photovoltaic module types because of their high flexibility. Silicon absorber material can be enhanced by adding germanium. Using the advantages of a band-gap reduced by the addition of germanium enables the absorption of light with a longer wavelength. The µc-Si1-XGeX:H absorbers investigated show the same efficiency as the µc-Si:H absorbers but with reduced thickness. Simulations of different planes of orientation and tilt that were simulated in terms of irradiance for bifacial modules. Results show that, even for Oldenburg, vertically installed modules with high bifaciality can receive more irradiance than monofacial modules with optimum tilt and orientation. A bifaciality of over 95 % can be achieved for single junction cells by redesigning the n-layer for high energy light transparency. The result is a semi-transparent bifacial solar module which meets the demands of many building integrated photovoltaic applications. <engl.>",

        "abstract": "In nanomedicine, synthetic nanoscale objects are utilized as vectors to transfer pharmaceutically active compounds into partiular cell types, where they are released in a controlled manner to address intracellular organelles selectively. Polymeric nanomaterials, which represent a material class of tremendous interest for drug delivery, are in focus of this present thesis. In order to study their mode-of-action and deduce comprehensive concepts of particle-cell interactions, high-performance imaging techniques represent a particularly valuable investigation platform, since they provide a direct insight into cellular uptake mechanisms as well as their intracellular distribution. For this reason, the present thesis pursues the implementation of two suitable imaging techniques providing information on a high-resolution level, i.e. fluorescence microscopy (FM) as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In this context, the utilization of carefully selected labeling strategies renders FM a powerful technique, which enables the unambiguous identification of the particles within their intracellular environment with an appropriate image contrast. Nonetheless, this method suffers from a poor resolution, so that individual particles cannot be sufficiently visualized. TEM, on the contrary, exhibits a resolution far beyond the particle size; however, polymeric nanomaterials do not show an appropriate image contrast alongside the cellular interior, which is a direct result of their similar electron contrasts. In this thesis, the implementation of both microscopy approaches into uptake studies is in focus, and the informative value of both methods is discussed. The advantages and drawbacks of both methods are pointed out, and it is illustrated that a comparison or even a correlation of both methods is highly beneficial to obtain a more complete insight. This discussion comprises as well different labeling strategies and experimental challenges.",

Since the time required for dynamic compilation directly influences a program's execution time, JIT compilers usually utilize only simple and fast techniques for program analysis and optimization. Program annotations can be used to improve the analysis and optimizitation process of a JIT compiler. Program annotations allow a mobile code system derive information about a program, on the producer side, and transmit that information along with the program to the consumer side. In this work, we present an inherently safe annotation technique for the safe transmission of escape information. The annotation technique described in this work is built on the SafeTSA mobile code format and is implemented as a simple extension of SafeTSA's type system. The space required for these annotations is minimal, and measurements of compilation time show that using information from an offline escape analysis in form of program annotations is evident faster than performing the escape analysis at runtime.",

        "abstract": "One of the main criteria determining the thermal comfort of occupants is the air temperature. To monitor this parameter, a thermostat is traditionally mounted in the indoor environment for instance in office rooms in the workplaces, or directly on the radiator or in another location in a room. One of the drawbacks of this conventional method is the measurement at a certain location instead of the temperature distribution in the entire room including the occupant zone. As a result, the climatic conditions measured at the thermostat point may differ from those at the user's location. This not only negatively impacts the thermal comfort assessment but also leads to a waste of energy due to unnecessary heating and cooling. Moreover, for measuring the distribution of the air temperature under laboratory conditions, multiple thermal sensors should be installed in the area under investigation. This requires high effort in both installation and expense.  To overcome the shortcomings of traditional sensors, Acoustic travel-time TOMography (ATOM) offers an alternative based on measuring the transmission sound velocity signals. The basis of the ATOM technique is the first-order dependency of the sound velocity on the medium's temperature. The average sound velocity, along the propagation paths, can be determined by travel-times estimation of a defined acoustic signal between transducers. After the travel-times collection, the room is divided into several volumetric grid cells, i.e. voxels, whose sizes are defined depending on the dimension of the room and the number of sound paths. Accordingly, the spatial air temperature in each voxel can be determined using a suitable tomographic algorithm. Recent studies indicate that despite the great potential of this technique to detect room climate, few experiments have been conducted.   This thesis aims to develop the ATOM technique for indoor climatic applications while coupling the analysis methods of tomography and room acoustics. The method developed in this thesis uses high-energy early reflections in addition to the direct paths between transducers for travel time estimation. In this way, reflections can provide multiple sound paths that allow the room coverage to be maintained even when a few or even only one transmitter and receiver are used.   In the development of the ATOM measurement system, several approaches have been employed, including the development of numerical methods and simulations and conducting experimental measurements, each of which has contributed to the improvement of the system's accuracy. In order to effectively separate the early reflections and ensure adequate coverage of the room with sound paths, a numerical method was developed based on the optimization of the coordinates of the sound transducers in the test room. The validation of the optimal positioning method shows that the reconstructed temperatures were significantly improved by placing the transducers at the optimal coordinates derived from the developed numerical method. The other numerical method developed is related to the selection of the travel times of the early reflections. Accordingly, the detection of the travel times has been improved by adjusting the lengths of the multiple analysis time-windows according to the individual travel times in the reflectogram of the room impulse response. This can reduce the probability of trapping faulty travel times in the analysis time-windows.   The simulation model used in this thesis is based on the image source model (ISM) method for simulating the theoretical travel times of early reflection sound paths. The simulation model was developed to simulate the theoretical travel times up to third-order reflections.   The empirical measurements were carried out in the climate lab of the Chair of Building Physics under different boundary conditions, i.e., combinations of different room air temperatures under both steady-state and transient conditions, and different measurement setups. With the measurements under controllable conditions in the climate lab, the validity of the developed numerical methods was confirmed.   In this thesis, the performance of the ATOM measurement system was evaluated using two measurement setups. The setup for the initial investigations consists of an omnidirectional receiver and a near omnidirectional sound source, keeping the number of transducers as few as possible. This has led to accurately identify the sources of error that could occur in each part of the measuring system. The second measurement setup consists of two directional sound sources and one omnidirectional receiver. This arrangement of transducers allowed a higher number of well-detected travel times for tomography reconstruction, a better travel time estimation due to the directivity of the sound source, and better space utilization. Furthermore, this new measurement setup was tested to determine an optimal selection of the excitation signal. The results showed that for the utilized setup, a linear chirp signal with a frequency range of 200 - 4000 Hz and a signal duration of t = 1 s represents an optimal selection with respect to the reliability of the measured travel times and higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).    To evaluate the performance of the measuring setups, the ATOM temperatures were always compared with the temperatures of high-resolution NTC thermistors with an accuracy of ±0.2 K. The entire measurement program, including acoustic measurements, simulation, signal processing, and visualization of measurement results are performed in MATLAB software.   In addition, to reduce the uncertainty of the positioning of the transducers, the acoustic centre of the loudspeaker was determined experimentally for three types of excitation signals, namely MLS (maximum length sequence) signals with different lengths and duration, linear and logarithmic chirp signals with different defined frequency ranges. For this purpose, the climate lab was converted into a fully anechoic chamber by attaching absorption panels to the entire surfaces of the room. The measurement results indicated that the measurement of the acoustic centre of the sound source significantly reduces the displacement error of the transducer position.    Moreover, to measure the air temperature in an occupied room, an algorithm was developed that can convert distorted signals into pure reference signals using an adaptive filter. The measurement results confirm the validity of the approach for a temperature interval of 4 K inside the climate lab.   Accordingly, the accuracy of the reconstructed temperatures indicated that ATOM is very suitable for measuring the air temperature distribution in rooms.",

This study presents empirical evidence that more is not better in international peacekeeping: more authority vested in a peace mission yields less effectiveness in curbing corruption.

Bridging the gap between large-N quantitative studies and single case studies, the study pursues a mixed methods design, employing statistical analyses as well as qualitative case studies of Sierra Leone, Côte D’Ivoire, Kosovo and Croatia. The analysis shows that highly intrusive peace missions are more likely to enable corruption than to constrain it. By contrast, missions with medium levels of intrusiveness are more likely to contribute to better control of corruption by acting as impartial arbitrators and by conditioning external assistance.",

        "abstract": "Tropical deforestation and forest degradation contributes to more than 20% of the global greenhouse gases emitted. Deforestation and its impacts can be more easily estimated with satellite images. Concerning forest degradation, it is difficult with the actual satellite image resolutions to evaluate accurately logging and biomass damage resulting from this activity though it contributes substantially to carbon emissions in the tropics. With increasing CO2 in the atmosphere, there is an urgent need of reliable biomass estimates and carbon pools in tropical forests, most especially in Africa where there is a serious lack of data. Moist tropical forests store large amounts of carbon and need accurate allometric regressions for their estimation. In Africa the absence of species-specific or mixed-species allometric equations has lead to a broad use of pan moist tropical equations to estimate tree biomass. This lack of information has raised many discussions on the accuracy of these data, since equations were derived from biomass collected outside Africa. Developing site-specific equations and pan-moist tropical equations including data from Africa is becoming very important for most ecologists for accurate estimations of this contribution extend, necessary for adaptation and mitigation strategies on climate change impacts. Allometric equations are key tools for climate change scenarios since they are used for estimating biomass and carbon pool at local, regional and world level. Information on net primary production (NPP) resulting from direct biomass field measurements of annual tree ring width is crucial in this context, to know how forest ecosystems will grow in the future with their possible impacts on carbon pools and fluxes and also to calibrate eddy covariance measurements ...",

        "abstract": "There is a palpable tension between the planning and implementation of climate targets, for instance as regards renewable energy resources - among which wind power plays a significant role. This tension comes to the fore when assessing the effectiveness of spatial planning approaches to the deployment of wind energy. Planning approaches to wind power are evaluated in three European urbanised regions: South Holland (Netherlands), Lower Austria (Austria) and East Flanders (Belgium). Each region has adopted wind energy targets and introduced zoned areas in its regional planning agenda. The theory of ‘new institutionalism’ and the comparative case study method are the two pillars of this investigation. Zoning may be considered as a form of institutional design, for the introduction of zoned areas not only determines the territorial spread of wind turbines, but also configures socio-organisational entities and actors involved in implementation (developers, local residents, consultants, and public authorities). The comparative approach demonstrates that planning choices in the three case studies often yield to the concerns of higher governance levels, clearly prioritising energy policy goals above local, contextual values. In consequence, ‘zones for wind energy’ do not always gain public acceptance at the local level. Indeed, the foundation for locally supported wind energy zones is laid down in the planning process itself. This process has the potential to institutionalise a trade-off between collective purposes at a higher governance level and locally changing contexts and values. On the other hand, planning agents need to be more aware of path dependencies in spatial decisions concerning renewable energy. One of the wider implications of the planning approaches studied is that they restrict, rather than promote development. Thus, when zoned areas had to be redrawn, local opposition or ‘unwillingness’ seriously restricted the amount of leeway for reaching a consensus about alternative locations. The reason was that the formal planning exercise (zoning wind energy) implied more than an impartial territorial designation: it also communicated social consensus on land-use decisions of ´where wind turbines would come´ and ´where they would not´",

        "abstract": "In this work the synthesis and characterization of small, stable and fluorescent poly-(acrylamide) NPs for sensing of chloride ions and pH is presented. The NPs were prepared by inverse microemulsion polymerization and characterized regarding their structural and fluorescence properties. Nearly all of the described NPs formed stable colloidal solutions in water and possessed a small diameter, sufficient monodispersity and a neutral surface-potential. Two different kinds of sensor particles were prepared: chloride-sensitive NPs with a physically entrapped indicator fluorophore and pH-sensitive NPs with a covalently bound indicator dye. The co-polymerization of a reference dye enabled ratiometric measurements in suspensions with both types of nanosensors. The nanosensors showed good response to the respective analyte, although the sensitivity was reduced by incorporation of the fluorophores inside the polymer matrix. The polymer matrix protected the fluorophores from undesired interaction with proteins and at the same time allowed small ionic analytes to pass through the polymer. The chloride nanosensors were transferred into living cells and their response was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy. After transfection of the cells, the NPs were located partially in small cellular organelles (endosomes) as well as in the cytosol. In order to enhance the cellular uptake and to force the endosomal escape of the NPs, different methods of functionalization were evaluated. Therefore, novel core-shell NPs with pH-independent size and a positive ?-potential were developed. Both, a pH-indicator fluorophore and a reference dye were co-polymerized to enable ratiometric pH-sensing. The signal magnitude in suspension was not as good as for the poly(acrylamide) NPs, although a clear correlation between the fluorescence intensity and the pH was obtained.",

As a starting point, optimal operating parameters were determined with 5 standard liters per minutes(slm)compressed air during the treatment of 10 ml deionized water within a treatment time of up to 15 min (pre-treatment time). Treatment times of 1, 3 and 5 min were selected (post-treatment time). In addition to physical parameters, i.e. temperature measurements at different spots at the plasma source during the production of the PTW, the chemical composition of PTW was determined by pH measurements, chronoamperometry (determination of the H2O2 concentration), ion chromatography (determination of the NO2-, NO3- and ONOO- concentrations) and mass spectrometry (qualitative determination of the molecules). In addition, concentration changes of reactive species over a period of 3 h indicated a decrease of the NO2- concentration as well as an increase of the NO3- and ONOO- concentration in the PTW.

In S. avermitilis such reaction could be monitored by analyzing the frequently observed guttation droplets, which might serve as reservoir for secondary metabolites in streptomycetes and fungi. Analyses showed that S. avermitilis formed guttation droplets mainly contained sucrose. S. avermitilis produced the sucrose from the nutrients of the medium. As reaction coculture with P. fluorescens the reduction of available sucrose amount was detected. This suggests that the sucrose could serve as energy storage, which is mobilized under the competitive pressure in the mixed culture. As well as non kind microorganisms have certain metal ions a stimulating effect on the secondary metabolism of streptomycetes. Therefore, the effects of cobalt ion stress Streptomyces coelicolor were characterized systematically. Relatively high concentration of cobalt ion in the medium induced the differentiation of a red and a blue colored phenotype of S. coelicolor. GC-MS analysis indicates that the two pigmented phenotypes produce a volatile profile different from the wild type. The volatile emission of S. coelicolor was characterized by the reduction of terpene release under cobalt ion stress.",

Different notions of ill-posedness in Banach spaces for linear and nonlinear inverse problems are discussed not only in standard settings but also in situations up to now not covered by the literature. Especially, ill-posedness of linear operators with uncomplemented null spaces is examined. Tools for convergence rate analysis of regularization methods are extended to a wider field of applicability. It is shown that the tool known as variational source condition always yields convergence rate results. A theory for nonlinear inverse problems with quadratic structure is developed as well as corresponding regularization methods. The new methods are applied to a difficult inverse problem from laser optics. Sparsity promoting regularization is examined in detail from a Banach space point of view. Extensive convergence analysis reveals new insights into the behavior of Tikhonov-type regularization with sparsity enforcing penalty",

Furthermore, RFBs can be precisely adapted to the generator unit. However, common metal-based RFBs utilize toxic and high-price metal salts, hazardous and corrosive acidic electrolytes, and expensive ion-exchange membranes. By the use of redox-active organic molecules and polymers, whose solubility and electrochemical properties can be adjusted, as active materials, these limitations can be overcome. In this thesis, the synthesis and electrochemical properties of redox-active small molecules as well as polymer-based organic active materials for the usage in RFBs are studied. In this context, all-organic symmetric redox-flow batteries and zinc-organic hybrid-flow batteries are described. Moreover, an all-organic combined RFB, which uses a polymer and a small-molecule compound as charge-storage materials, is developed and the key factors in terms of its battery performance are investigated in detail.",

        "abstract": "This thesis addresses an adaptive higher-order method based on a Geometry Independent Field approximatTion(GIFT) of polynomial/rationals plines over hierarchical T-meshes(PHT/RHT-splines). In isogeometric analysis, basis functions used for constructing geometric models in computer-aided design(CAD) are also employed to discretize the partial differential equations(PDEs) for numerical analysis. Non-uniform rational B-Splines(NURBS) are the most commonly used basis functions in CAD. However, they may not be ideal for numerical analysis where local refinement is required. The alternative method GIFT deploys different splines for geometry and numerical analysis. NURBS are utilized for the geometry representation, while for the field solution, PHT/RHT-splines are used. PHT-splines not only inherit the useful properties of B-splines and NURBS, but also possess the capabilities of local refinement and hierarchical structure. The smooth basis function properties of PHT-splines make them suitable for analysis purposes. While most problems considered in isogeometric analysis can be solved efficiently when the solution is smooth, many non-trivial problems have rough solutions. For example, this can be caused by the presence of re-entrant corners in the domain. For such problems, a tensor-product basis (as in the case of NURBS) is less suitable for resolving the singularities that appear since refinement propagates throughout the computational domain. Hierarchical bases and local refinement (as in the case of PHT-splines) allow for a more efficient way to resolve these singularities by adding more degrees of freedom where they are necessary. In order to drive the adaptive refinement, an efficient recovery-based error estimator is proposed in this thesis. The estimator produces a recovery solution which is a more accurate approximation than the computed numerical solution. Several two- and three-dimensional numerical investigations with PHT-splines of higher order and continuity prove that the proposed method is capable of obtaining results with higher accuracy, better convergence, fewer degrees of freedom and less computational cost than NURBS for smooth solution problems. The adaptive GIFT method utilizing PHT-splines with the recovery-based error estimator is used for solutions with discontinuities or singularities where adaptive local refinement in particular domains of interest achieves higher accuracy with fewer degrees of freedom. This method also proves that it can handle complicated multi-patch domains for two- and three-dimensional problems outperforming uniform refinement in terms of degrees of freedom and computational cost.",

Cockchafer larvae are known as severe pests in agriculture and forestry. The present study adresses three relevant aspects of their chemical ecology linked to food choice belowground: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of several potential host plant roots and shoots are investigated and analysed by using gas chromatography  mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The obtained volatile patterns of damaged roots differ clearly from the undamaged ones. Emitted shoot volatiles differ clearly from the emitted root volatiles. Electrophysiological methods are employed to record sensory reactions of the detached larval antennae to several of the previously identified compounds. Volatile emissions of Quercus sp. are investigated in detail. By using electroantennography (EAG), changes in the receptor potential elicited by odour stimuli are recorded. It turns out that seasonal and maybe also circadian rhythms appear to play an important role in cockchafer larvae antenna physiology. The behavioural response of cockchafer larvae is tested on selected compounds. A dual choice test setup is designed to study the behavioural orientation of the belowground living larvae. Attractive and repellent compounds in host plants are identified. Preparative methods show the antennal lobes (ALs, first central processing unit for olfactory information processing in the insect brain) of 3rd instar of M. hippocastani to contain a high number of glomeruli, which are regarded as the functional subunits of odour discrimination ...",

With this aim, the conventional transient absorption spectroscopy method is first utilized to characterize semiconducting monolayers and organic nanosheet semiconductors. Although these are physically thin, they present relatively strong transient absorption signals of a few mOD (units of optical density), which allows to characterize their excited state dynamics with the conventional machinery, not needing further signal enhancements or complex noise-minimizing techniques. Nonetheless, the former does not represent the reality of detecting the transient photoexcited dynamics of few-layered systems.

Moreover, a method was derived to predict properties of the electron density distribution quantitatively via combinations of vibrational spectroscopic and NMR spectroscopic data. Furthermore, the initial changes in the electron density distribution upon photoexcitation and related changes in the molecular structure were investigated via resonance Raman spectroscopy. The results of all these studies are shortly summarized in the following. After the impact and the limitations of electron density studies are outlined in the \"Introduction\" (chapter 1), the basic tools to calculate and analyze the electron density distribution ư(r) are summarized in chapter 2 \"Theoretical details\". In section 4.1 an illustrative example of ư(r)-studies in the life sciences was discussed in detail. This example is related to an investigation of Schirmeister and Luger, who studied the selectivity of an inhibition reaction of an aziridine derivative functioning as a protease inhibitor. For that purpose they determined the electron densities at the carbon atoms within the aziridine ring via high resolution x-ray measurements of an aziridine single crystal and via DFT-calculations of an isolated aziridine molecule. Continuing the work of Schirmeister and Luger the inʿuences of neighboring molecules on ư(r) and therewith on the electrophilicity of the aziridine carbons were studied to shed light on the impact of intermolecular interactions on the electron density distribution ư(r). It turned out that NHN-hydrogen bridges and intermolecular interactions between dimethylmalonate moieties exhibit opposite inʿuences on the aziridine ring.

The author establishes a new formulation of statistical mechanics based on the TPQ states. This formulation allows us to obtain not only mechanical variables but also thermodynamic variables such as entropy and free energy from a single TPQ state. Furthermore, the formulation provides a new physical description in which all fluctuations including thermally driven ones are uniquely identified to be quantum fluctuations. The use of TPQ formulation has practical advantages in its application to numerical computations and allows for significant reduction in computation cost in numerics. For demonstration purposes, a numerical computation based on TPQ formulation is applied to a frustrated two-dimensional quantum spin model, and the result is also included in this book. .",

        "abstract": "This book mainly focuses on the theoretical and experimental study of non-Fourier heat conduction behavior. A novel thermomass theory is used as the theoretical basis, which provides a general heat conduction equation for the accurate prediction of non-Fourier heat conduction. In order to prove the validity of this thermomass theory, a large current was used to heat the metallic nanofilm at the minimum temperature of 3 K. The measured average temperature of the nanofilm was notably higher than the prediction of Fourier’s heat diffusion equation, while matching well with the general heat conduction equation. This is the first time that steady non-Fourier heat conduction has been observed. Moreover, this book concerns the role of electron-phonon interaction in metallic nanofilms, which involves the breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law at low temperatures and interfacial thermal resistance at femtosecond timescales. Readers will find useful information on non-Fourier heat conduction and the latest advances in the study of charge and heat transport in metallic nanofilms",

        "abstract": "Within gauge/gravity duality, we study the class of four dimensional CFTs with chiral anomaly described by Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in five dimensions. In the first part of this thesis we compute quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the metric and gauge field perturbations about electrically and magnetically charged black branes. By the gauge/gravity correspondence, this theory is dual to a particular class of field theories with a chiral anomaly, in a thermal charged plasma state subjected to a constant external magnetic field B. The QNMs are dual to the poles of the two-point functions of the energy-momentum tensor and axial current operators, and they encode information about the dissipation and transport of charges in the plasma. Complementary to the gravity calculation, we work out the hydrodynamic description of the dual field theory in the presence of a chiral anomaly, and a constant external B. We find QNMs exhibiting Landau level behavior, which become long-lived at large B if the anomaly coefficient exceeds a critical magnitude. Chiral transport is analyzed beyond the hydrodynamic approximation for the five (formerly) hydrodynamic modes, including a chiral magnetic wave. In the second part we consider the phase diagram at finite temperature, chemical potential and magnetic field B. At high temperatures the solution is given by the electrically and magnetically charged AdS Reissner-Nordstroem black brane, studied in first part of this thesis. For sufficiently large Chern-Simons coupling and at sufficiently low temperatures and small magnetic fields, we find a new phase with helical order, breaking translational invariance spontaneously. For the Chern-Simons couplings studied, the phase transition is second order with mean field exponents. Since the entropy density vanishes in the limit of zero temperature we are confident that this is the true ground state which is the holographic version of a chiral magnetic spiral.",

        "abstract": "Proteins are natural polypeptides produced by cells; they can be found in both animals and plants, and possess a variety of functions. One of these functions is to provide structural support to the surrounding cells and tissues. For example, collagen (which is found in skin, cartilage, tendons and bones) and keratin (which is found in hair and nails) are structural proteins. When a tissue is damaged, however, the supporting matrix formed by structural proteins cannot always spontaneously regenerate. Tailor-made synthetic polypeptides can be used to help heal and restore tissue formation. Synthetic polypeptides are typically synthesized by the so-called ring opening polymerization (ROP) of α-amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides (NCA). Such synthetic polypeptides are generally non-sequence-controlled and thus less complex than proteins. As such, synthetic polypeptides are rarely as efficient as proteins in their ability to self-assemble and form hierarchical or structural supramolecular assemblies in water, and thus, often require…",

In an attempt to draw a historical reconstruction based on systematic data, a test case area in the »heart« of ancient Galilee was chosen for this research. Uzi Leibner used two distinct disciplines: the study of the relevant historical sources and the advanced archaeological field survey. Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic sources concerning settlements in the region were translated and discussed. Some fifty archaeological sites from the periods under discussion were identified and surveyed. The analysis of the finds enabled the author to draw a detailed portrait of settlement - including periods of construction, abandonment, prosperity and decline in each site and in the region as a whole. This book sheds new light on major historical issues such as the origins of the Galilean Jewry in the Second Temple Period, the First Jewish Revolt and its outcomes, the Jews of Galilee under Christian regime, demography, economy, continuity and decline",

        "abstract": "In littoral zones of lakes, multiple processes determine lake ecology and water quality. Lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD), most frequently taking place in littoral zones, can transport or mobilize nutrients from the sediments and thus contribute significantly to lake eutrophication. Furthermore, lake littoral zones are the habitat of benthic primary producers, namely submerged macrophytes and periphyton, which play a key role in lake food webs and influence lake water quality. Groundwater-mediated nutrient-influx can potentially affect the asymmetric competition between submerged macrophytes and periphyton for light and nutrients. While rooted macrophytes have superior access to sediment nutrients, periphyton can negatively affect macrophytes by shading. LGD may thus facilitate periphyton production at the expense of macrophyte production, although studies on this hypothesized effect are missing. The research presented in this thesis is aimed at determining how LGD influences periphyton, macrophytes, and the interactions ...",

While peoples’ wants and needs are unlimited, resources are often scarce, making it necessary to research the possible alternatives and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision. Nowadays, the Internet has become the main source of information when it comes to comparing alternatives, making search engines the primary means for collecting new information. However, relying only on term matching is not sufficient to adequately address requests for comparisons. Therefore, search systems should go beyond this approach to effectively address comparative information needs. In this dissertation, I explore from different perspectives how search systems can respond to comparative questions. First, I examine approaches to identifying comparative questions and study their underlying information needs. Second, I investigate a methodology to identify important constituents of comparative questions like the to-be-compared options and to detect the stance of answers towards these comparison options. Then, I address ambiguous comparative search queries by studying an interactive clarification search interface. And finally, addressing answering comparative questions, I investigate retrieval approaches that consider not only the topical relevance of potential answers but also account for the presence of arguments towards the comparison options mentioned in the questions. By addressing these facets, I aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to effectively satisfy the information needs of searchers seeking to compare different alternatives.",

Starting from Shannon's model of information processing, a special lattice spin Hamiltonian is used which is well suited for both source coding and for modeling information loss within the Bayesian framework. By applying a high-temperature expansion the parameter estimation problem is solved analytically using transfer-matrix methods. A Monte Carlo simulation restores the distorted image utilizing the statistical information about the source and the channel. Beyond its inherent practical usefulness the image restoration problem illustrates directly basic concepts related to information theory, statistical inference, and perception. The work is split mainly in two parts: Chapters 1 to 4 contain a summary of the problem and existing models, Chapters 5 to 7 introduce the new models and illustrate their capabilities in a variety of experiments. The conclusion can be found in Chapter 8. <engl.>",

In order to understand the interplay between the quantum critical fluctuations and the phase formation, comprehensive thermodynamic information is essential. This thesis reports the results of both specific-heat and magnetocaloric experiments carried out with a bespoke experimental apparatus whose design particularly addresses the demanding constraints of the low-temperature, high-magnetic-field environment. The experimental data give evidence for unusual thermodynamic properties of the novel phase and its bounding phase transitions. Furthermore they show that the phase formation takes place against a background of strongly peaking entropy, suggesting that quantum criticality plays a key role in the physics of this system.",

Unlike other urban histories of Britain, the book shows how the city helped produce rather than merely reflect the major intellectual and ideological currents that transformed its recent history. Each chapter of the book tells the story of a different type of urban space in Britain. The first part of the book traces the emergence of the industrial trading estate, the shopping center and the council estate. The second part shows how these three forms mutated into the private block of flats, the out-of-town shopping mall and the suburban office park. The story of these six forms touches on histories of criminology, histories of energy and heating, histories of consumerism and the history of housework and takes the reader to almost every major British city as well as to the United States, Singapore and the Britain's Empire in West Africa. Urban history in Britain has been dormant for too long and its hoped that this book will reignite the field. As the author explains, Foundations will be the first, comprehensive and academic history of Britain's modern built environment and thus will have a large and enduring readership both within and outside the academy\"--"

        "abstract": "Black slates of different oxidation states and graphite samples as pure carbon source were incubated with the white-rot fungus Schizophyllum commune 4-39 for 3 months. Investigations by SEM showed fungal affinity to rough surfaces. Oxidatively weathered, bleached black slate samples have more micropores and increased surface roughness than unweathered samples. Unpolished and polished bleached black slate samples were colonized best by fungal hyphae. The hyphae often entered pores. Etch pits induced by fungal activity could be observed which were then quantified by vertical scanning interferometry (VSI). The etch pits measured 3  4 ?m in width and 180  200 nm in depth. In contrast to black slate samples, more etch pits were found on graphite surfaces. Moreover, they showed a more elongated morphology and branches reminiscent of fungal growth morphology. Under laboratory conditions, Schizophyllum commune was able to degrade about 0.03 ?m3/?m2 rock material during 3 months of incubation. It could be shown that collapsed hyphae material remained in their etch pits even after sample preparation which was caused by strong fungal fixation to the rock surfaces. The higher carbon content and the softness of pressed graphite thus allow for earlier fungal attachment and higher dissolution rates. Amounts of nitrogen could be proved by chemical analyzing techniques (x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron microprobe) at all incubated rock samples. Nitrogen increased eminently on rock surfaces due to fungal colonization. Amounts of nitrogen were detected both on hyphae and former hyphae attachment areas. This indicates the presence of fungus and/or fungal excreted proteins such as hydrophobins for attachment or enzymes for degradation.",

        "abstract": "Porous materials are an emerging branch of engineering materials that are composed of two elements: One element is a solid (matrix), and the other element is either liquid or gas. Pores can be distributed within the solid matrix of porous materials with different shapes and sizes. In addition, porous materials are lightweight, and flexible, and have higher resistance to crack propagation and specific thermal, mechanical, and magnetic properties. These properties are necessary for manufacturing engineering structures such as beams and other engineering structures.  These materials are widely used in solid mechanics and are considered a good replacement for classical materials by many researchers recently. Producing lightweight materials has been developed because of the possibility of exploiting the properties of these materials. Various types of porous material are generated naturally or artificially for a specific application such as bones and foams. Like functionally graded materials, pore distribution patterns can be uniform or non-uniform. Biot’s theory is a well-developed theory to study the behavior of poroelastic materials which investigates the interaction between fluid and solid phases of a fluid-saturated porous medium. Functionally graded porous materials (FGPM) are widely used in modern industries, such as aerospace, automotive, and biomechanics. These advanced materials have some specific properties compared to materials with a classic structure. They are extremely light, while they have specific strength in mechanical and high-temperature environments.  FGPMs are characterized by a gradual variation of material parameters over the volume. Although these materials can be made naturally, it is possible to design and manufacture them for a specific application. Therefore, many studies have been done to analyze the mechanical and thermal properties of FGPM structures, especially beams. Biot was the pioneer in formulating the linear elasticity and thermoelasticity equations of porous material. Since then, Biot's formulation has been developed in continuum mechanics which is named poroelasticity. There are obstacles to analyzing the behavior of these materials accurately like the shape of the pores, the distribution of pores in the material, and the behavior of the fluid (or gas) that saturated pores. Indeed, most of the engineering structures made of FGPM have nonlinear governing equations. Therefore, it is difficult to study engineering structures by solving these complicated equations. The main purpose of this dissertation is to analyze porous materials in engineering structures. For this purpose, the complex equations of porous materials have been simplified and applied to engineering problems so that the effect of all parameters of porous materials on the behavior of engineering structure has been investigated. The effect of important parameters of porous materials on beam behavior including pores compressibility, porosity distribution, thermal expansion of fluid within pores, the interaction of stresses between pores and material matrix due to temperature increase, effects of pore size, material thickness, and saturated pores with fluid and unsaturated conditions are investigated.  Two methods, the deep energy method, and the exact solution have been used to reduce the problem hypotheses, increase accuracy, increase processing speed, and apply these in engineering structures. In both methods, they are analyzed nonlinear and complex equations of porous materials. To increase the accuracy of analysis and study of the effect of shear forces, Timoshenko and Reddy's beam theories have been used. Also, neural networks such as residual and fully connected networks are designed to have high accuracy and less processing time than other computational methods.zeige weniger",

        "abstract": "Although it is impractical to avert subsequent natural disasters, advances in simulation science and seismological studies make it possible to lessen the catastrophic damage. There currently exists in many urban areas a large number of structures, which are prone to damage by earthquakes. These were constructed without the guidance of a national seismic code, either before it existed or before it was enforced. For instance, in Istanbul, Turkey, as a high seismic area, around 90% of buildings are substandard, which can be generalized into other earthquakeprone regions in Turkey. The reliability of this building stock resulting from earthquake-induced collapse is currently uncertain. Nonetheless, it is also not feasible to perform a detailed seismic vulnerability analysis on each building as a solution to the scenario, as it will be too complicated and expensive. This indicates the necessity of a reliable, rapid, and computationally easy method for seismic vulnerability assessment, commonly known as Rapid Visual Screening (RVS). In RVS methodology, an observational survey of buildings is performed, and according to the data collected during the visual inspection, a structural score is calculated without performing any structural calculations to determine the expected damage of a building and whether the building needs detailed assessment. Although this method might save time and resources due to the subjective/qualitative judgments of experts who performed the inspection, the evaluation process is dominated by vagueness and uncertainties, where the vagueness can be handled adequately through the fuzzy set theory but do not cover all sort of uncertainties due to its crisp membership functions. In this study, a novel method of rapid visual hazard safety assessment of buildings against earthquake is introduced in which an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) is used to cover uncertainties. In addition, the proposed method provides the possibility to evaluate the earthquake risk of the building by considering factors related to the building importance and exposure. A smartphone app prototype of the method has been introduced. For validation of the proposed method, two case studies have been selected, and the result of the analysis presents the robust efficiency of the proposed method.",

            "The focus of this thesis is the engineering and analysis of the enantioselectivity of esterases using 3-phenylbutyric acid (3-PBA) as model substrate. An ultra high throughput assay for identification of enantioselective esterases has been developed, based on the combination of in vivo selection and flow cytometry. The in vivo selection medium consists of a couple of pseudo-enantiomers of 3-PBA; one enantiomer is coupled to glycerol (GE), and hydrolysis of this substrate will enable cell survival. The other enantiomer is coupled to the toxin 2,3-dibromopropanol (BE), the hydrolysis of this substrate will cause cell death. Thus, cell survival is a function of the enantioselectivity of the enzyme expressed. The pseudo-enantiomeric substrates are structurally similar to allow selection for enantioselectivity instead of selection for enzyme substrate affinity. Next, esterase BS2 was chosen as negative control to establish the selection system since it hydrolyses both pseudo-enantiomers with low enantioselectivity (E~3 and 1, respectively). High enantioselective esterases towards 3-PBA: esterases PestE and CL1 (E > 100, both (R)-selective) were identified in a screening and used as positive controls. Further, the hyperthermophilic esterase PestE was crystallized. After elucidation of the enzyme structure, the high enantioselectivity of the enzyme towards 3-PBA could be explained by molecular modelling ...",

        "abstract": "This thesis consists (mainly) of three parts: At first, we define Hausdorff measures for product spaces of local fields. We look at iterated function systems on such spaces, the Hausdorff dimension of their attractor is estimated. Afterwards, model sets (respectively cut and project sets) are introduced. For point sets generated by a substitution rule, we state criteria that ensure that the point set in question is a model set. These results are applied to Pisot substitutions. It is conjectured that all (one-dimensional) point sets generated by a Pisot substitution are model sets. A list of equivalent statements for this conjecture is given. In the first part of Chapter 4 we show that the Haar measure on a product space of local fields is a Hausdorff measure (Theorem 4.56). Then, iterated function systems and their attractors are introduced. Generalising results of K. J. Falconer (on R^n), upper (Prop. 4.122) and in some cases lower (Lemma 4.126 & Props. 4.127 & 4.129) bounds for the Hausdorff dimension (as well as the box-counting dimension (Lemma 4.133)) for these attractors are derived. The main theme of Chapter 5 are model sets (cut and project sets) and Delone point sets that are generated by a substitution, and their interplay. Following Baake-Moody, the construction of a cut and project scheme for a multi-component Delone set is derived in Section 5.3. This construction is extended and modified for substitution point sets (Section 5.7.3) if there is a so-called algebraic or overlap coincidence; indeed, one obtains an extended internal space here (Prop. 5.137). The main theorem of this chapter is Theorem 5.154 which states equivalent conditions under which a substitution point set is a model set: Either the substitution has an algebraic or overlap coincidence, or there exist certain aperiodic tilings of the (extended) internal space ...",

This result is used to verify the origin of the force and to study various bodies of simple shapes. In the second part, a genuinely dynamical approach is developed by starting from the operator Lorentz force. It is found that the dynamics of the force on initially excited atoms is governed by irreversible spontaneous decay in the case of weak atom-field coupling, while Rabi oscillations may arise for strong atom-field coupling.",

Prosodic reconstruction refers to the idea that sentences involving syntactic movement show prosodic parallels with corresponding simpler structures without movement. I propose to model this recurrent observation by ordering syntax-prosody mapping before copy deletion. In order to account for the partial fronting data, the idea is extended to the mapping between prosody and information structure. This assumption helps to explain why object-initial sentences containing a broad focus or broad contrastive topic show similar prosodic and interpretative restrictions as sentences with canonical word order. The empirical adequacy of the model is tested against a set of gradient acceptability judgments.",

Tools for convergence rate analysis of regularization methods are extended to a wider field of applicability. It is shown that the tool known as variational source condition always yields convergence rate results. A theory for nonlinear inverse problems with quadratic structure is developed as well as corresponding regularization methods. The new methods are applied to a difficult inverse problem from laser optics. Sparsity promoting regularization is examined in detail from a Banach space point of view. Extensive convergence analysis reveals new insights into the behavior of Tikhonov-type regularization with sparsity enforcing penalty.--",

        "abstract": "During the last century, navigation systems have become ubiquitous and guide drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians towards their desired destinations. While operating worldwide, they rely on line-of-sight conditions towards satellites and are thus limited to outdoor areas. However, finding a gate within an airport, a ward within a hospital, or a university's auditorium also represent navigation problems. To provide navigation within such indoor environments, new approaches are required. This thesis examines pedestrian 3D indoor localization and navigation using commodity smartphones: A desirable target platform, always at hand and equipped with a multitude of sensors. The IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) and barometer allow for pedestrian dead reckoning, that is, estimating relative location changes. Absolute whereabouts can be determined via Wi-Fi, an infrastructure present within most public buildings, or by using Bluetooth Low Energy Beacons as inexpensive supplement. The building's 3D floorplan not only enables navigation, but also increases accuracy by preventing impossible movements, and serves as a visual reference for the pedestrian. All aforementioned information is fused by recursive density estimation based on a particle filter. The conducted experiments cover both, theoretical backgrounds and real-world use-cases. All discussed approaches utilize the infrastructure found within most public buildings, are easy to set up, and maintain. Overall, this thesis results in an indoor localization and navigation system that can be easily deployed, without requiring any special hardware components.",

        "abstract": "This book applies the convex integration method to multi-dimensional compressible Euler equations in the barotropic case as well as the full system with temperature. The convex integration technique, originally developed in the context of differential inclusions, was applied in the groundbreaking work of De Lellis and Székelyhidi to the incompressible Euler equations, leading to infinitely many solutions. This theory was later refined to prove non-uniqueness of solutions of the compressible Euler system, too. These non-uniqueness results all use an ansatz which reduces the equations to a kind of incompressible system to which a slight modification of the incompressible theory can be applied. This book presents, for the first time, a generalization of the De Lellis–Székelyhidi approach to the setting of compressible Euler equations. The structure of this book is as follows: after providing an accessible introduction to the subject, including the essentials of hyperbolic conservation laws, the idea of convex integration in the compressible framework is developed. The main result proves that under a certain assumption there exist infinitely many solutions to an abstract initial boundary value problem for the Euler system. Next some applications of this theorem are discussed, in particular concerning the Riemann problem. Finally there is a survey of some related results. This self-contained book is suitable for both beginners in the field of hyperbolic conservation laws as well as for advanced readers who already know about convex integration in the incompressible framework.",

The nearest neighbor Heisenberg ferromagnetic ranks among the oldest and most fundamental models of quantum many body effects. It has long been established that in one dimension quantum fluctuations lead to a quantum disordered ground state with fractional excitations called spinons.\" In two dimensions, the ground state of the Heisenberg model displays static order and to first approximation the dynamics can be described as semi-classical spin waves. Through theoretical advances the author demonstrates that at high energy around particular points in reciprocal space these semi-classical spin-waves deconfine into fractional excitations akin to the one-dimensional spinons. He thereby provides the first explanation of a long-standing experimental observation. In the second half of his thesis Bastien Dalla Piazza develops a unified description of the magnetic excitation spectra of a range of cuprate parent compounds to the high temperature superconductors."

While social and economic development in recent years altered the flood risk patterns mainly with regard to an increase in flood exposure, different flood events are further expected to increase in frequency and severity in certain European regions due to climate change. As a result of recent major flood events in Germany, the German flood risk management shifted to more integrated approaches that include private precaution and preparation to reduce the damage on exposed assets. Yet, detailed insights into the preparedness decisions of flood-prone households remain scarce, especially in connection to mental impacts and individual coping strategies after being affected by different flood types.

        "abstract": "Abstract: Vast reserves of anthracite coal have been detected in the Quang Ninh province in the northeastern region of Vietnam (reserves~6.3 Gt). Cam Pha, located in the Quang Ninh province, is one of the largest anthracite coal mining areas. Coal mining activities are a source of atmospheric pollution and are also detrimental to water quality. These factors are a hazard to human health.  <br>This study is aimed at characterizing the forms of environmental pollution derived from coal mining activities and mine waste. Mining leads to environmental damage through airborne dust, acid mine drainage and chemical weathering of waste rock. One aim of this study was to  identify the source of airborne dust in this area and its chemical and physical properties were characterized, as well as its effects on human health, focusing on identifying the source of  the coal miners’ occupational diseases.  A second aim was to determine the effects of acid mine drainage on water quality near the largest coal mine in the area.  In order to achieve these goals, field samples including: airborne particles, coal and waste rock, material in overburden piles, mine tailings,  dumps, water samples and the lung lavage samples were collected. The mineral composition of solid samples was determined by using a variety of complementary microscopic and bulk analysis techniques (e.g. EMPA, XRD, SEM/EDS, F-AAS, GF-AAS, ICP-MS). The results showed that dust, lung lavages and waste rock were composed of the same mineral components, such as: quartz, kaolinite, illite and muscovite. Furthermore, the bulk chemical composition of airborne particles were investigated which were then compared to the composition of other solid samples (e.g. waste rock, coal). To establish a link between airborne dust particles and these materials, it is of utmost importance to understand the geological features of coal mining area. Finally, a relationship between trace metal concentrations in solid samples (e.g waste rock, coal, airborne dust), the rice paddy soils in Cam Pha and the lung lavages from miners were found in the Cam Pha mining area",

            "Abstract: In recent years, common goods have increasingly become an object of public and scientific discourse. With regards to collective land use, a particularly interesting aspect is the extent to which interdependencies exist between ownership types and the resource utilised. This topic is addressed in this dissertation project with respect to community forests. This ownership model, by which the members possess shares of the common area and use the forest collectively, has been documented since the middle ages. In particular regions, these communities are still found in large numbers today. On the basis of their development history, management approaches and objectives, common areas can exhibit very different forest types and structures. Given that in some cases the communities still practice traditional coppicing, such areas may have significant conservation value.<br>The aim of this project was to investigate the relationships between the forest communities and structural parameters in the managed landscapes. The development and current situation of the communities were examined and a characterisation of their forests was undertaken. On this basis, the question of how the communities’ forests differ structurally from one another and from other ownership types was addressed. Here, emphasis was placed on the nature conservation value of the existing structures. Furthermore, the question of which factors determine the existing structures and whether the ownership type as such has an influence was investigated. A possible transferability of the findings to models of cooperative land and resource use was also observed.<br>These questions were examined in two study areas within the German low mountain ranges (northern Saarland, southern Rhineland-Palatinate / Westerwald, Siegerland, Sauerland, Bergisches Land). These are characterised by a wide spectrum of differently evolved community types. In particular, Heckengesellschaften, Gehöferschaften, Hauberggenossen-schaften, Waldinteressentenschaften, Jahnschaften and Waldnachbarschaften were examined. Methodologically, the study consisted of two strands of research, the results of which were blended together. On the one hand, the forest communities with their development histories, operating modes and management approaches as well as their objectives and external framework conditions were examined. In addition to literature analysis, qualitative methods of empirical social research – namely expert inter ...",

Bei gemeinschaftlichen Landnutzungen ist besonders der Aspekt interessant, inwiefern Wechselwirkungen zwischen der Eigentumsform und der genutzten Ressource bestehen. Dieser Thematik nimmt sich dieses Dissertationsprojekt anhand der Gemeinschaftswälder an. Dieses Eigentumsmodell, bei welchen die Mitglieder ideelle Anteile an der Gemeinschaftsfläche besitzen und den Wald gemeinschaftlich nutzen, ist seit dem Mittelalter belegt. In bestimmten Regionen finden sich diese Institutionen heute noch gehäuft. Bedingt durch verschiedene Entstehungsgeschichten, Wirtschaftsweisen und Zielsetzungen können die Gemeinschaftsflächen sehr unterschiedliche Waldbilder aufweisen. Die verschiedenen und zum Teil historischen Nutzungsformen (Niederwald) legen eine naturschutzfachliche Bedeutung dieser Wälder nahe.<br>Ziel der Arbeit war es, Zusammenhänge zwischen den Waldgemeinschaften und strukturellen Parametern in den bewirtschafteten Landschaften zu erfassen. Es sollte die Situation der Gemeinschaften beleuchtet sowie die Frage beantwortet werden, wie sich ihre Wälder untereinander und von denen anderer Besitzarten strukturell unterscheiden. Hierbei wurde ein Schwerpunkt auf die naturschutzfachliche Wertigkeit der vorhandenen Waldstrukturen gelegt. Weiterhin wurde der Frage nachgegangen, welche Faktoren diese Strukturen bedingen und ob die Eigentumsart als solche einen Einfluss hat. Auch eine mögliche Übertragbarkeit der Erkenntnisse auf andere Formen der gemeinschaftlichen Land- bzw. Ressourcennutzung wurde betrachtet.<br>Untersucht wurden diese Fragen in zwei Untersuchungsgebieten in deutschen Mittelgebirgen (nördliches Saarland, südliches Rheinland-Pfalz / Westerwald, Siegerland, Sauerland, Bergisches Land).

        "abstract": "This thesis represents the first double differential measurement of quasi-elastic anti-neutrino scattering in the few GeV range--a region of substantial theoretical and experimental interest as it is the kinematic region where studies of charge-parity (CP) violation in the neutrino sector most require precise understanding of the differences between anti-neutrino and neutrino scatter. This dissertation also presents total antineutrino-scintillator quasi-elastic cross sections as a function of energy, which is then compared to measurements from previous experiments.  Next-generation neutrino oscillation experiments, such as DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande, hope to measure CP violation in the lepton sector. In order to do this, they must dramatically reduce their current levels of uncertainty, particularly those due to neutrino-nucleus interaction models. As CP violation is a measure of the difference between the oscillation properties of neutrinos and antineutrinos, data about how the less-studied antineutrinos interact is especially valuable. The measurement described herewith determines the nuclear and instrumental effects that must be understood to undertake precision neutrino physics. As well as being useful to help reduce oscillation experiments' uncertainty, this data can also be used to study the prevalence of various correlation and final-state interaction effects within the nucleus. In addition to being a substantial scientific advance, this thesis also serves as an outstanding introduction to the field of experimental neutrino physics for future students.",

The model adopts the nonlocal moment method, i.e., the system of the balance equations resulting from the moments of the radially dependent Boltzmann equation is solved. The electron transport and rate coefficients are adapted as functions of the mean energy of the electrons, the gas temperature and the ionization degree. The model is applied to a description of the constriction of the dc positive column in argon, for a wide range of pressures and applied currents. Pronounced nonlocal features of the mean electron energy balance are found and their influence on the constricted argon positive column is analyzed..."

        "abstract": "Climate models predict an increasing frequency and intensity of summer drought periods with subsequent heavy rainfall or soil frost and thaw events in mountain regions of Central Europe. These indirect effects of global warming may considerably influence soil microbial processes and in consequence emissions of climate-relevant trace gases. Regarding the nitrogen cycle, N2O and NO emissions are of concern, since they are involved in climate warming and soils represent a main source for these two gases. In spite of a growing number of studies on this subject, knowledge on effects of climate change on soil N2O and NO emissions is still scarce. This is mainly due to a hitherto poor mechanistic understanding of underlying processes within soil. In this thesis, the impact of extreme meteorological boundary conditions on N2O and NO fluxes in a Norway spruce forest and an acidic fen in the Fichtelgebirge area was investigated. The summer drought period and precipitation were experimentally increased in the forest and the fen over a 2-year span. Soil frost was induced in the forest by removal of the natural snow cover. The experiments were run in three replicates each and non-manipulated plots served as controls. Throughout the experiments, N2O and NO fluxes were recorded in weekly to monthly intervals. In addition, N2O concentrations and isotope signatures in soil air were measured along soil profiles to identify and localise the underlying biogenic production and consumption processes. Prolonged drought continuously reduced the N2O emission from the forest soil and even turned the soil temporarily into a sink for atmospheric N2O. Soil freezing and thawing caused a burst of N2O release contributing 84 % of the annual emission ...",

        "abstract": "Ontologies are the prime way of organizing data in the Semantic Web. Often, it is necessary to combine several, independently developed ontologies to obtain a knowledge graph fully representing a domain of interest. Existing approaches scale rather poorly to the merging of multiple ontologies due to using a binary merge strategy. Thus, we aim to investigate the extent to which the n-ary strategy can solve the scalability problem. This thesis contributes to the following important aspects: 1. Our n-ary merge strategy takes as input a set of source ontologies and their mappings and generates a merged ontology. For efficient processing, rather than successively merging complete ontologies pairwise, we group related concepts across ontologies into partitions and merge first within and then across those partitions. 2. We take a step towards parameterizable merge methods. We have identified a set of Generic Merge Requirements (GMRs) that merged ontologies might be expected to meet. We have investigated and developed compatibilities of the GMRs by a graph-based method. 3. When multiple ontologies are merged, inconsistencies can occur due to different world views encoded in the source ontologies To this end, we propose a novel Subjective Logic-based method to handling the inconsistency occurring while merging ontologies. We apply this logic to rank and estimate the trustworthiness of conflicting axioms that cause inconsistencies within a merged ontology. 4. To assess the quality of the merged ontologies systematically, we provide a comprehensive set of criteria in an evaluation framework. The proposed criteria cover a variety of characteristics of each individual aspect of the merged ontology in structural, functional, and usability dimensions. 5. The final contribution of this research is the development of the CoMerger tool that implements all aforementioned aspects accessible via a unified interface.",

The main outcomes of this work are: (i) the analysis of the crossover from diffusive to ballistic spin transport regimes in ultraclean graphene nonlocal devices, and (ii) investigation of spin transport and spin dynamics phenomena (such as the (quantum) spin Hall effect) in novel topological materials, such as monolayer Weyl semimetals WeTe2 and MoTe2. Indeed, the ballistic spin transport results are key for further interpretation of ultraclean spintronic devices, and will enable extracting precise values of spin diffusion lengths in diffusive transport and guide experiments in the (quasi)ballistic regime. Furthermore, the thesis provides an in-depth theoretical interpretation of puzzling huge measured efficiencies of the spin Hall effect in MoTe2, as well as a prediction of a novel canted quantum spin Hall effect in WTe2 with spins pointing in the yz plane.",

        "abstract": "Organic semiconductors are a promising class of materials. Their special properties are the particularly good absorption, low weight and easy processing into thin films. Therefore, intense research has been devoted to the realization of thin film organic solar cells (OPVs). Because of the low dielectric constant of organic semiconductors, primary excitations (excitons) are strongly bound and a type II heterojunction needs to be introduced to split these excitations into free charges. Therefore, most organic solar cells consist of at least an electron donor and electron acceptor material.

            "This thesis describes a method to control rare events in non-equilibrium systems by applying physical forces to those systems but without relying on numerical simulation techniques, such as copying rare events. In order to study this method, the book draws on the mathematical structure of equilibrium statistical mechanics, which connects large deviation functions with experimentally measureable thermodynamic functions. Referring to this specific structure as the “phenomenological structure for the large deviation principle”, the author subsequently extends it to time-series statistics that can be used to describe non-equilibrium physics. The book features pedagogical explanations and also shows many open problems to which the proposed method can be applied only to a limited extent. Beyond highlighting these challenging problems as a point of departure, it especially offers an effective means of description for rare events, which could become the next paradigm of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics."

            "This book addresses problems in three main developments in modern condensed matter physics- namely topological superconductivity, many-body localization and strongly interacting condensates/superfluids-by employing fruitful analogies from classical mechanics. This strategy has led to tangible results, firstly in superconducting nanowires: the density of states, a smoking gun for the long sought Majorana zero mode is calculated effortlessly by mapping the problem to a textbook-level classical point particle problem. Secondly, in localization theory even the simplest toy models that exhibit many-body localization are mathematically cumbersome and results rely on simulations that are limited by computational power. In this book an alternative viewpoint is developed by describing many-body localization in terms of quantum rotors that have incommensurate rotation frequencies, an exactly solvable system. Finally, the fluctuations in a strongly interacting Bose condensate and superfluid, a notoriously difficult system to analyze from first principles, are shown to mimic stochastic fluctuations of space-time due to quantum fields. This analogy not only allows for the computation of physical properties of the fluctuations in an elegant way, it sheds light on the nature of space-time. The book will be a valuable contribution for its unifying style that illuminates conceptually challenging developments in condensed matter physics and its use of elegant mathematical models in addition to producing new and concrete results",

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional shape measurement has become essential in many areas, such as quality control in industrial production or digitization of complex free-form surfaces. Stereo recording based on the principle of pattern projection is often used on diffusely reflecting surfaces. Objects with non-cooperative surfaces, such as transparent, shiny, absorbent, or translucent objects, could not be reliably recorded with this technology until now. In previous studies it was shown that the shape from heating approach can be used to record non-cooperative surfaces in three dimensions. This method is based on pattern projection in the thermal infrared, absorption under generation of a heat pattern, and stereo recording of the reemission. However, the measurement time in the double digit second range has been relatively long and the measurement accuracy insufficient for many applications. In this study, a simulation model for the entire thermal measurement process is developed. With the help of this tool, the interaction between the infrared radiation and the object as well as the generation of a temperature contrast is investigated. From this, limits of the multi-fringe projection are concluded and the novel projection principle of sequential fringes is developed. Instead of an areal multi-fringe projection, the new method irradiates the object only in locally strongly restricted areas. This results in irradiation times in the millisecond range, which drastically reduces the influence of thermal diffusion. The new 3D sensor based on sequential fringe projection has impressively demonstrated the advantages over multi-fringe projection. Besides the significant reduction of measurement times and improvement of measurement accuracy, the recordable material classes are extended to objects with higher thermal conductivity. The presented sensor is thus the world’s fastest and most accurate measurement system for high-resolution optical 3D shape measurement of non-cooperative surfaces.",

        "abstract": "Isogeometric analysis (IGA) is a numerical method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), which was introduced with the aim of integrating finite element analysis with computer-aided design systems. The main idea of the method is to use the same spline basis functions which describe the geometry in CAD systems for the approximation of solution fields in the finite element method (FEM). Originally, NURBS which is a standard technology employed in CAD systems was adopted as basis functions in IGA but there were several variants of IGA using other technologies such as T-splines, PHT splines, and subdivision surfaces as basis functions. In general, IGA offers two key advantages over classical FEM: (i) by describing the CAD geometry exactly using smooth, high-order spline functions, the mesh generation process is simplified and the interoperability between CAD and FEM is improved, (ii) IGA can be viewed as a high-order finite element method which offers basis functions with high inter-element continuity and therefore can provide a primal variational formulation of high-order PDEs in a straightforward fashion. The main goal of this thesis is to further advance isogeometric analysis by exploiting these major advantages, namely precise geometric modeling and the use of smooth high-order splines as basis functions, and develop robust computational methods for problems with complex geometry and/or complex multi-physics. As the first contribution of this thesis, we leverage the precise geometric modeling of isogeometric analysis and propose a new method for its coupling with meshfree discretizations. We exploit the strengths of both methods by using IGA to provide a smooth, geometrically-exact surface discretization of the problem domain boundary, while the Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM) discretization is used to provide the volumetric discretization of the domain interior. The coupling strategy is based upon the higher-order consistency or reproducing conditions that are directly imposed in the physical domain. The resulting coupled method enjoys several favorable features: (i) it preserves the geometric exactness of IGA, (ii) it circumvents the need for global volumetric parameterization of the problem domain, (iii) it achieves arbitrary-order approximation accuracy while preserving higher-order smoothness of the discretization. Several numerical examples are solved to show the optimal convergence properties of the coupled IGA–RKPM formulation, and to demonstrate its effectiveness in constructing volumetric discretizations for complex-geometry objects. As for the next contribution, we exploit the use of smooth, high-order spline basis functions in IGA to solve high-order surface PDEs governing the morphological evolution of vesicles. These governing equations are often consisted of geometric PDEs, high-order PDEs on stationary or evolving surfaces, or a combination of them. We propose an isogeometric formulation for solving these PDEs. In the context of geometric PDEs, we consider phase-field approximations of mean curvature flow and Willmore flow problems and numerically study the convergence behavior of isogeometric analysis for these problems. As a model problem for high-order PDEs on stationary surfaces, we consider the Cahn–Hilliard equation on a sphere, where the surface is modeled using a phase-field approach. As for the high-order PDEs on evolving surfaces, a phase-field model of a deforming multi-component vesicle, which consists of two fourth-order nonlinear PDEs, is solved using the isogeometric analysis in a primal variational framework. Through several numerical examples in 2D, 3D and axisymmetric 3D settings, we show the robustness of IGA for solving the considered phase-field models. Finally, we present a monolithic, implicit formulation based on isogeometric analysis and generalized-alpha time integration for simulating hydrodynamics of vesicles according to a phase-field model. Compared to earlier works, the number of equations of the phase-field model which need to be solved is reduced by leveraging high continuity of NURBS functions, and the algorithm is extended to 3D settings. We use residual-based variational multi-scale method (RBVMS) for solving Navier–Stokes equations, while the rest of PDEs in the phase-field model are treated using a standard Galerkin-based IGA. We introduce the resistive immersed surface (RIS) method into the formulation which can be employed for an implicit description of complex geometries using a diffuse-interface approach. The implementation highlights the robustness of the RBVMS method for Navier–Stokes equations of incompressible flows with non-trivial localized forcing terms including bending and tension forces of the vesicle. The potential of the phase-field model and isogeometric analysis for accurate simulation of a variety of fluid-vesicle interaction problems in 2D and 3D is demonstrated.",

In their purest form, these models are maximally supersymmetric (N = 4), and thus only contain superpartners in their matter sector. This feature makes their systematic construction particularly efficient, and they are thus useful in their simplicity. The thesis first provides a brisk introduction to heterotic strings and the spin-structure construction of free fermionic models. Three systematic surveys are then presented, and it is conjectured that these surveys are exhaustive modulo redundancies. Finally, the author presents a collection of metaheuristic algorithms for searching the landscape for models with a user-specified spectrum of phenomenological properties, e.g. gauge group and number of spacetime supersymmetries. Such algorithms provide the groundwork for extended generic free fermionic surveys.",

In situ aerodynamic levitation with laser heating was combined with neutron scattering in order to study both liquid-liquid phase transitions in (Y2O3)x(Al2O3)1-x, and the atomic and magnetic ordering in liquid Invar. Among several significant results, obtained in this case from small angle neutron scattering, was the absence of a phase transition across a range of temperatures and compositions in the yttria aluminates.  As these are a principal system in which liquid-liquid phase transitions have been hypothesized, this is an important contribution in a contentious area",

        "abstract": "Material properties play a critical role in durable products manufacturing. Estimation of the precise characteristics in different scales requires complex and expensive experimental measurements. Potentially, computational methods can provide a platform to determine the fundamental properties before the final experiment. Multi-scale computational modeling leads to the modeling of the various time, and length scales include nano, micro, meso, and macro scales. These scales can be modeled separately or in correlation with coarser scales. Depend on the interested scales modeling, the right selection of multi-scale methods leads to reliable results and affordable computational cost. The present dissertation deals with the problems in various length and time scales using computational methods include density functional theory (DFT), molecular mechanics (MM), molecular dynamics (MD), and finite element (FE) methods. Physical and chemical interactions in lower scales determine the coarser scale properties. Particles interaction modeling and exploring fundamental properties are significant challenges of computational science. Downscale modelings need more computational effort due to a large number of interacted atoms/particles. To deal with this problem and bring up a fine-scale (nano) as a coarse-scale (macro) problem, we extended an atomic-continuum framework. The discrete atomic models solve as a continuum problem using the computationally efficient FE method.  MM or force field method based on a set of assumptions approximates a solution on the atomic scale. In this method, atoms and bonds model as a harmonic oscillator with a system of mass and springs. The negative gradient of the potential energy equal to the forces on each atom. In this way, each bond's total potential energy includes bonded, and non-bonded energies are simulated as equivalent structural strain energies. Finally, the chemical nature of the atomic bond is modeled as a piezoelectric beam element that solves by the FE method.  ...",

        "abstract": "This work introduces a novel extension of the Python software \"Environment for Combining Optimization and Simulation Software'' (EFCOSS). The extension addresses the solution of optimization problems of different types. Various problem instances that demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in new practical application scenarios include geothermal engineering and material science. In a more general context, EFCOSS enables to investigate the questions of which parameter values best fit a given computer model to measurements from real-world experiments, how should such experiments be designed with minimal uncertainty, which computer models should be used for a specific task, and how can the efficiency of such investigations be improved by using simpler models. These questions are addressed by employing techniques from parameter estimation, space mapping, optimal experimental design, and model identification that are implemented and brought together in EFCOSS. To this end, the internal structure of EFCOSS had to be redesigned completely to introduce a new software architecture based on standard Python packages. This new architecture allows for multiple optimization problems, objective functions, and simulation routines to be used within a single application. Simulation models of geothermal reservoirs in the regions of Perth in Australia and Tuscany in Italy are used as illustrating examples of optimal experimental design to find the location of new borehole sites that introduce low uncertainty in the parameter estimation. Furthermore, new parameter estimation problems are solved using space-mapping algorithms. Model identification is applied to metal-plasticity models to investigate different kinds of models. By combining automatic differentiation, parallelization, and reuse of intermediate results, the serial runtimes of the described problems are reduced from several weeks to minutes.",

            "This book focuses on the microscopic understanding of the function of organic semiconductors. By tracing the link between their morphological structure and electronic properties across multiple scales, it represents an important advance in this direction. Organic semiconductors are materials at the interface between hard and soft matter: they combine structural variability, processibility and mechanical flexibility with the ability to efficiently transport charge and energy. This unique set of properties makes them a promising class of materials for electronic devices, including organic solar cells and light-emitting diodes. Understanding their function at the microscopic scale – the goal of this work – is a prerequisite for the rational design and optimization of the underlying materials. Based on new multiscale simulation protocols, the book studies the complex interplay between molecular architecture, supramolecular organization and electronic structure in order to reveal why some materials perform well – and why others do not. In particular, by examining the long-range effects that interrelate microscopic states and mesoscopic structure in these materials, the book provides qualitative and quantitative insights into e.g. the charge-generation process, which also serve as a basis for new optimization strategies."

        "abstract": "Collagen is the most abundant protein in mammals. In many tissues, collagen molecules assemble to form a hierarchical structure. In the smallest supramolecular unit, named fibril, each molecule is displaced in the axial direction with respect to its neighbors. This staggering creates a periodic gap and overlap regions, where the gap regions exhibit 20% less density. These fibril-forming collagens play an essential role in the strength of connective tissues. Despite much effort, directed at understanding collagen function and regulation, the influence of the chemical environment on the local structural and mechanical properties remains poorly understood. Recent studies, aimed at elucidating the effect of osmotic pressure, showed that collagen contracts upon water removal. This observation highlights the importance of water for the stabilization and mechanics of the collagen molecule. Using collagen mimetic peptides (CMPs), which fold into triple helical structures reminiscent of natural collagen, the primary goal of this work was to investigate the effect of the osmotic pressure on specific collagen-mimetic sequences. ...",

        "abstract": "The pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) is a complex of at least 15 genetically different host races that are native to specific legume plants but can all develop on the universal host plant Vicia faba. Despite much research, it is still unclear why pea aphid host races can accept and colonize their native host plants while non-native host races are not. To determine the changes in the host plant chemistry and their possible influence in the specificity of the pea aphid host races, we used several metabolomics aproaches on full factorial experimental set ups by infesting separately four different plant species (Medicago sativa, Trifolium pratense, Pisum sativum, and Vicia faba) with native and non-native pea aphid clones of various host races. Our results from the non-targeted and targeted approaches suggested that the plant species investigated have developed different complexities of chemicals to defend themselves from the attack of herbivores including phloem feeders. Our results also suggested that A. pisum clones have evolved different feeding strategies to manipulate the host plant defense signaling, reduced deterrence or toxicity, improved host quality, reduction of enemies, and improved quality of future food sources in the vicinity to perform better on these plants. We have selected a group of polar and non-polar secondary metabolites that might be associated with the discrimination and compatibility of the pea aphid host races with the different legume species used in this project. However, additional experimentation is necessary to fully understand the effects and influence of these compounds in the specificity of the pea aphid host races.",

It focuses on competition law implications caused by the monopoly of the state-owned postal service operator, which has dominated the market for centuries, against the backdrop of efforts to liberalise, privatise and thereby open the market to other postal delivery companies. Subsequently, the author examines this regulatory framework in terms of the newest legal and economic developments within the postal sector, taking contemporary requirements into account. As a result of this examination, he establishes what reform is needed in the light of the ever-changing legal requirements and market conditions. In this context and taking into account efforts to establish equitable competition, the author concludes that the current regulatory framework has to be not only maintained but also partially intensified, whereas at the same time the competence of the regulatory authority, i.e. the Federal Network Agency, has to be expanded.",

Several methods have been suggested in the literature to reliably determine links in a network.

Initial analyses demonstrate the impact of falsepositive and false negative conclusions about the presence or absence of links on the resulting inferred network. Consequently, revealing the importance of making well-considered choices leads to suggest new approaches to enhance existing network reconstruction methods.

We start with the study of the effect of natural selection on genealogies. We make use of the theory on tree-valued Fleming-Viot processes that describe the evolution of genealogical trees to compute the Laplace-transform of the tree length both in the neutral and in the selective setting. We show that trees are shorter in the selective case (under the so-called Laplace-transform-order) than trees under neutrality - an assumption already widely believed to be true in the field of biology.<br>In the second part we work with a mutation-selection model in a fluctuating environment by introducing a modifier locus determining the mutation rate at a second locus. Fitness acts on the second locus and changes as the environment fluctuates. For a fast fluctutating environment, we obtain limit results for the evolution of allele frequencies and apply them to a two-type setting in which we compute the fixation probability for the higher mutation rate.<br>The last part focuses on analysing human DNA samples and estimating their heritage. The aim is to extend the already existing models for inferring individual admixture proportions - a vector of which each entry corresponds to the fraction of one's genome originating from a certain population. We develop a method that delivers individual admixture proportions of an individual's parents. This enables us to test whether the admixture of two populations has occured only recently or several generations ago. We apply both the already existing method and our new method to the 1000 genomes dataset and test the accuracy of their outputs by computing the distance to their true admixture proportions",

The paradigm of monocular camera localization encompasses broad range of applications like place recognition, loop closure detections within a SLAM framework, 6-DoF metric camera pose estimation and augmented reality. To achieve accurate and reliable pose estimates, camera-based localization approaches need to cope with wide variety of challenging perceptual conditions. These methods should be robust to variation in illumination due to day-night changes, different weather conditions and seasonal variations. An autonomous robot should be able to cope with all such variations that enables it to operate over long periods of time.<br>In this thesis, we primarily focus on novel robust methods for long term camera-based visual localization that cope with wide variety of viewing conditions. We highlight the shortcomings of state-of-the-art feature-based methods for monocular cameras and present novel approaches to achieve reliable localization. Although, cameras provide an cost effective solution for autonomous navigation, image data is highly vulnerable to environmental conditions. The rich texture and color information in the images vary drastically over long periods of time. In this work, we develop distinctive and repeatable feature descriptions of images that allow robots to localize under a great spectrum of perceptual conditions. We also develop novel methods that leverage semantics of the environment to imitate human-like behavior in autonomous systems during localization. These methods also scale well with the large map sizes. <br>At first, we discuss both the advantages and shortcomings of the visual information from the cameras for longterm localization. We identify the drawbacks of traditional sparse feature-based methods for longterm localization and propose dense feature descriptions to cope with the pitfalls. We show that by leveraging the sequential nature of the recorded and live data stream from the robot within a network flow graph framework enables to remove false loop closure hypothesis and achieve more precise location estimates. This enables the robot to achieve robust topological localization in a place recognition framework.

The results are also adaptable to the context of nonlinear least squares problems subject to nonlinear equality constraints.

Several novel molecular designs for controlling crystal structures with photo-physical properties are described, with a special focus on external stimuli-responsive properties. The major goal of the material design concept was to capitalize on the chirality of crystals with stimuli-responsive properties. To allow crystals’ chirality to be controlled and modified by means of external stimulation, the axial chirality of biaryl moiety was employed and, interestingly, produced several novel mechano- and vapo-responsive luminescent properties based on crystal-to-crystal or single-crystal-to-single-crystal phase transitions. In addition, the book details how the molecular rotation of luminophores in the solid phase can be used to achieve corresponding thermal-responsive phosphorescence. The reports presented here illustrate how the author has succeeded in controlling structural factors in a bulk environment by using molecular design with linking to photo-physical properties.

These data suggest that CRY-DASH1 plays its role as regulator at the posttranscriptional/translational level. CRY-DASH1 has an absorption peak in the UV-A range and supplementation of white light with UV-A increases photoautotrophic growth of wild type but not of the mutant lacking CRY-DASH1. Comparative analysis of the chloroplast proteome of wild type and of the mutant revealed that multiple proteins, including key enzymes for the synthesis of chlorophylls and carotenoids, as well as acyl-lipid metabolism and photoprotection, are upregulated in the mutant. In contrast, we found that essential proteins from the central carbon metabolism, are downregulated. Additionally, we discovered that the mutant revealed a downregulation of certain enzymes involved in histidine metabolism which leads to a reduction in the quantity of free histidine. Another cryptochrome, CRY-DASH2, when mutated, exhibited similar growth reduction and pigment increase. The study ends pondering if CRY-DASH1 and CRY-DASH2 might have overlapping functionalities.",

        "abstract": "The thesis describes the supramolecular organization of homo- and heteropolynuclear complexes, containing different paramagnetic centers, going from d-block metal ions to combination of d-f spin carriers topologies. These polynuclear complexes have been structurally and spectroscopically characterized, and partly magnetostructural correlations have been performed. The synthesis of polynuclear complexes has been based on self-assembly and rational strategies. Iron(iii) aza-crown complexes have been isolated through self-assembly reaction between N-imidazol-2-yl-salicyloyl hydrazide and FeX3·xH2O salts in presence of pseudo-halide coligands. These complexes are characterized by antiferromagnetic coupling between the Fe(iii) centers. In addition, self-assembly of easy accessible Schiff base ligands and d-block metal salts led to homo-polynuclear d-complexes with the magnetic interaction varying from strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the paramagnetic centers to ferromagnetic interaction induced by accidental orthogonality of the magnetic orbitals associated to d-metal ions in partial-cubane structural core. The rational strategy approach is divided in two subcategories, namely the dendritic approach and ʺcomplex-as-ligandʺ strategy. The dendritic approach is based upon C3-symmetric triaminoguanidine-Schiff base ligand derivatives which present three-fold tridentate coordination pockets.",

The population of autoionizing doubly excited states in the laser fields is proven and a possible connection to the well-known dielectronic recombination processes is discussed. The fundamental process of tunnel ionization in strong laser fields is subject of investigation in a pump-probe experiment with ultrashort laser pulses. A coherent superposition of electronic states in singly charged argon ions is created within the first, and subsequently tunnel-ionized with the second pulse. This gives access to state-selective information about the tunneling process and allows to test common models. Moreover, the ionization of krypton and argon at different wavelengths is studied, from the multiphoton to the tunneling regime. The wavelength-dependent investigations are furthermore extended to molecular hydrogen. In addition to ionization, this system might undergo different dissociative processes. Channel-selective electron momentum distributions are presented and compared to each other.",

Thus, great effort has been spent on tracking changes in precipitation and relating them to underlying processes. Particularly in the face of global warming and given the link between temperature and atmospheric water holding capacity, research is needed to understand the effect of climate change on precipitation.

With a high density of population and assets, urban areas are not only the economic, cultural and social hubs of every society, they are also highly susceptible to natural disasters. As a consequence of rising sea levels and an expected increase in extreme weather events caused by a changing climate in combination with growing cities, flooding is an increasing threat to many urban agglomerations around the globe.To mitigate the destructive consequences of flooding, appropriate risk management and adaptation strategies are required. So far, flood risk management in urban areas is almost exclusively focused on managing river and coastal flooding. Often overlooked is the risk from small-scale rainfall-triggered flooding, where the rainfall intensity of rainstorms exceeds the capacity of urban drainage systems, leading to immediate flooding. Referred to as pluvial flooding, this flood type exclusive to urban areas has caused severe losses in cities around the world. [...]",

The extreme instability of the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) prevents its use as an effective treatment for patients with a Moco deficiency. Therefore, the design, develop and execute the artificial molybdenum cofactor models are essential. In the present thesis, the asymmetric molybdopterin (mpt) model precursors with oxygen functionality and various electronic structures and their Moco model complexes mimicking the natural cofactor have been synthesized and comprehensively investigated through multi-nuclear NMR, MS, IR, resonance Raman, X-ray crystallography, UV-Vis, and electrochemical methods.

The redox behavior of Moco model complexes was investigated by temperature-dependent cyclic voltammetry. Electronic and vibrational spectral studies were investigated in detail to understand substituents effect on the electronic structure of model complexes and to elucidate roles of mpt in catalysis.

This work develops a new single droplet model of combined solution drying and free radical homopolymerisation, based on the method of moments. New, consistent approaches for momentsâ diffusion and the reaction-diffusion system are derived to ensure conservation. Simulations reveal peculiarities of the process such as that, due to drying, polymerisation happens mostly in bulk and monomer evaporation leads to a poor yield. Various process variants and simulation models are discussed. The impact of process parameters is examined by means of numerical DoEs. The second part presents a novel approach for the simulation of structure evolution in suspension drying. The meshfree SPH method is used to model the relevant physical effects on a detailed scale during the first and second drying period. New implementations of physical effects are derived: heat and mass transfer based on linear driving forces, an implicit solution of the heat equation, several approaches for crust formation and a new formulation of surface tension by pairwise forces. The formation of dense structures as well as hollow granules can be simulated. Model parameters influence crust formation during the second drying period concerning shape and microporosity and can be interpreted in a physical sense",

            "The multiphysically coupled modelling and numerical simulation of mass transport in polymeric materials is investigated. Coupled behaviour arises in these materials due to molecular interactions of the polymer chains with the transported particles or fluids. Due to these interactions, mass transport in polymers is often associated with large deformations and significant changes of the mechanical behaviour that, in turn, may lead to cracking and failure. On the other hand, this behaviour can be utilised deliberately, for example for microstructuring or in smart materials. Thus, a detailed understanding of the processes involved is necessary. In this thesis, a model for multiphysically coupled mass transport in the framework of nonlinear continuum mechanics is developed. The governing equations describing two different example cases, namely, anomalous Case II diffusion and electroactive polymers, are derived from fundamental balance principles and equipped with suitable constitutive equations. For the description of Case II diffusion, a novel relation for the diffusion flux is developed that accounts for the delayed kinetics resulting from the molecular interactions and, thus, allows to describe the characteristic transport behaviour during Case II diffusion. To accurately model the processes occurring in composites of nanoporous metals filled with different types of electroactive polymers, the interface elasticity theory is extended to chemoelectromechanical coupling, yielding a framework that allows to describe deformation, electrostatics and charge carrier transport and their interactions in the bulk material and on the metal/polymer interface. These models are subsequently implemented into a finite element code and numerical studies are carried out to elucidate the models’ capabilities and provide insight into the coupled nature of the investigated phenomena.",

In diesen Materialien tritt gekoppeltes Verhalten aufgrund von molekularen Wechselwirkungen zwischen den Polymerketten und den transportierten Partikeln oder Fluiden auf. Aufgrund dieser Wechselwirkungen geht Massentransport in Polymeren häufig mit großen Deformationen und signifikanten Änderungen des mechanischen Verhaltens einher, die wiederum zur Bildung von Rissen und zum Materialversagen führen können. Andererseits ist es möglich dieses gekoppelte Verhalten bewusst auszunutzen, zum Beispiel in der Mikrostrukturierung oder in so genannten Intelligenten Werkstoffen. Daher ist es wichtig, ein tiefes Verständnis der grundlegenden Prozesse zu erlangen. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird ein kontinuumsmechanisches Modell für multiphysikalisch gekoppelten Massentransport entwickelt. Die grundlegenden Gleichungen, die das erhalten von zwei ausgesuchten Beispielfällen, nämlich Case II-Diffusion und elektroaktiven Polymeren, beschreiben, werden dabei aus physikalischen Bilanzen abgeleitet und mit geeigneten Konstitutivgleichungen ergänzt. Zur Beschreibung der anormalen Case II-Diffusion wird ein neuartiges Diffusionsgesetz hergeleitet, das die verzögerte Transportkinetik, die aus den molekularen Wechselwirkungen resultiert, berücksichtigt und es so ermöglicht, das charakteristische Verhalten der Case II diffusion zu beschreiben. Um die Prozesse, die in Kompositen von nanoporösen Metallen mit elektroaktiven Polymeren ablaufen, abzubilden, wird die Grenzflächenelastizitätstheorie auf chemoelektromechanische Kopplung erweitert. So wird ein grundlegendes Modell entwickelt, das es erlaubt, Deformation, Elektrostatik, Ladungsträgertransport und ihre Interaktionen sowohl im Volumen als auch auf der Metall/Polymer-Grenzfläche zu beschreiben. Diese Modelle werden weiterhin in einen Finite Elemente-Code implementiert, mit dem numerische Studien durchgeführt werden, um die Möglichkeiten der entwickelten Modelle zu untersuchen und Einsichten in die gekoppelte Natur der untersuchten Phänomene zu erlangen."

        "abstract": "The present study focuses on technological developments in the history of glass technology. I selected four aspects of glass manufacture from different periods, beginning in the earliest period of artificial glass and ending in the Early Modern time. The technology of glass manufacture was investigated by analysis of archaeological glass samples and the reproduction of used materials. The experimental approach enabled a detailed understanding of the challenges and specifications during the manufacture. In a first study, the formation of potential borosilicate layers on Mycenaean LBA relief fragments, that have been found close to gold sheet, were studied. We could demonstrate by infrared reflection spectroscopy that both borate contamination on gold and borax powder interact with the glass surface at temperatures above 800 ◦C. I suggested three mechanisms for potential borate contamination, that is by alteration of the gold sheet, the glass surface or the usage borax as a solder. The second study analyses the opacification process of Roman mosaic tesserae by the calcium antimonates CaSb2O6 and Ca2Sb2O7, and demonstrates that the in-situ crystallization at temperatures below 1200 ◦C produces the most reliable opacification. We reproduced the process in an experimental archaeological glass furnace at temperatures around 1050 ◦C. In a third study, I analyzed a selection of a Medieval glass feature from Münster, Germany, by X-ray fluorescence and optical spectroscopy. I demonstrate that the glass samples were made by at least three recipes. The fourth study focuses on the scattering properties of Cu2O and Cu0 particles with different sizes. I show by simulation of the Mie backscattering and absorption cross sections, how the optical spectra change depending on the particle size and the wavelength of light. Comparison with two late medieval / early modern sample sets from Glashütten, Germany and Wieda, Germany and fitting the backscattering curves into the UV/Vis/NIR reflectance spectra yielded an average Cu0 particle radius of 60 nm to 95 nm. The results were confirmed by SEM microscopy.",

        "abstract": "Although it has become common practice to build applications based on the reuse of existing components or services, technical complexity and semantic challenges constitute barriers to ensuring a successful and wide reuse of components and services. In the geospatial application domain, the barriers are self-evident due to heterogeneous geographic data, a lack of interoperability and complex analysis processes. Constructing workflows manually and discovering proper services and data that match user intents and preferences is difficult and time-consuming especially for users who are not trained in software development. Furthermore, considering the multi-objective nature of environmental modeling for the assessment of climate change impacts and the various types of geospatial data (e.g., formats, scales, and georeferencing systems) increases the complexity challenges. Automatic service composition approaches that provide semantics-based assistance in the process of workflow design have proven to be a solution to overcome these…",

        "abstract": "Plant phenology is regarded as the integrative measure of plant response to environmental changes and also plays an important role in influencing the climate through altering ecosystem structure and functioning (Richardson et al. 2013). However, how the different drivers especially the environmental factors beyond climate and biotic factors influence the phenology is still not revealed. This is particularly challenging in the tree-grass ecosystems in drylands as they have a complex structure and changing the limiting resources throughout the year (Sardans and Peñuelas 2013, Nair et al. 2019). A better understanding of the relationship between drivers and phenology or dynamics of canopy development and functioning is critical importance for us to better predict the land carbon dynamics in the drylands, which is the most important contributor to the trend and interannual variability of global carbon uptake (Ahlstrom et al., 2015; Poulter et al., 2014). By using multiple measurements (field measurements, satellite, PhenoCam, high spectral-resolution spectroradiometer measurements, and eddy covariance (EC) data), we studied the relationship between the canopy structure development (used vegetation indexes (VIs) as the proxies) and functioning dynamics (e.g.dynamics of carbon and water fluxes), and the response of their seasonality metrics to different drivers in a Mediterranean tree-grass ecosystem. Through the large nutrient manipulation experiment, we investigated how nutrients and water availability co-shapes the seasonality of greenness and ecosystem functioning. By probing the spectral properties of evergreen leaves, we tested if the leaf age plays a critical role in regulating the tree canopy greenness.",

            "The search for neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the highest priority areas in particle physics today; it could provide insights to the nature of neutrino masses (currently not explained by the Standard Model) as well as how the universe survived its early stages.

The results from this thesis constitute a significant advance in this area, laying the groundwork for several highly effective and novel approaches based on a detailed evaluation of state-of-the-art detector characteristics. This well written thesis includes a particularly clear and comprehensive description of the theoretical motivations as well as impressively demonstrating the effective use of diverse statistical techniques.

        "abstract": "The measurement of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays is an important tool to reveal the nature of cosmic rays. In order to measure the cosmic rays up to an energy of 10**18 eV, the KASCADE experiment was extended to KASCADE-Grande. It is a ground based detector to measure extensive air showers, which are initiated by the primary particles of the cosmic radiation. In order to obtain the energy spectrum, data from December 2003 to September 2007 are analyzed by using the method of constant intensity. This method is applied to the number of charged particles in an air shower and leads to a zenith angle independent number of charged particles, which is a measure of the shower size. Simulations of air showers are then used to calibrate the shower size to the primary energy. Thus, the primary energy spectrum in the energy range of 10**16 eV to 10**18 eV is determined. In the energy region from 10**16 eV to 10**17 eV the resulting spectrum and the spectrum measured with KASCADE overlap. Both measurements are in good agreement in this energy range. Due to the extended energy range, the energy spectrum of KASCADE-Grande connects the KASCADE spectrum with the measurements of experiments like AGASA, Auger and HiRes, which measure up to the highest energies of cosmic rays.",

            "The bacterial production of tailored wax esters (WE) from plant oil and other organic compounds was demonstrated using the bacterium Alcanivorax jadensis T9. Previous screening of more than 50 marine bacteria had shown that many of them produced WE on incubation with different plant oils. WE produced on rapeseed oil (RP) resembled WE in human sebum. Selected n-fatty acid, n-alcohol, n-alkane or triacylglyceride substrates led to the formation of WE with their acid and alcohol moieties mainly directly derived from the substrates. Additional WE of different chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation showed that the bacterium shortened, elongated or desaturated the substrate’s carbon chains before WE synthesis. n-Alcohols were most suitable considering the amounts of WE produced. Two-component mixtures revealed selective WE metabolism. n-Alcohols plus RP led to variable amounts of WE and an extended WE spectrum compared to n-alcohols alone. Tripalmitate, RP or n-hexadecene with C16 substrates reduced WE production compared to the C16 compounds alone. Research in this field should aim at an industrial use of specifically tailored WE e. g. in skin care or medicine. <engl.>",

        "abstract": "Salt deposits offer a variety of usage types. These include the mining of rock salt and potash salt as important raw materials, the storage of energy in man-made underground caverns, and the disposal of hazardous substances in former mines. The most serious risk with any of these usage types comes from the contact with groundwater or surface water. It causes an uncontrolled dissolution of salt rock, which in the worst case can result in the flooding or collapse of underground facilities. Especially along potash seams, cavernous structures can spread quickly, because potash salts show a much higher solubility than rock salt. However, as their chemical behavior is quite complex, previous models do not account for these highly soluble interlayers. Therefore, the objective of the present thesis is to describe the evolution of cavernous structures along potash seams in space and time in order to improve hazard mitigation during the utilization of salt deposits.",

        "abstract": "Numerical relativity (NR) simulations are crucial for studying the coalescence of compact binaries. Based on NR data, we produce a model for the mass and spin of the remnant black hole (BH) for the coalescence of black hole-neutron star systems, discussing its crucial role in gravitational wave (GW) modeling and in the parameter estimation of the two signals GW200105 and GW200115. In the context of binary neutron star merger simulations, we perform the first systematic study comparing results obtained with various neutrino treatments, the presence of turbulent viscosity and different grid resolutions. We find that the time of BH formation after merger is heavily affected by grid resolution and turbulent viscosity. An early BH formation limits matter ejection from the accretion disc, as the BH swallows a significant portion of it. Our results indicate that more reliable kilonova light curves are obtained only if the various ejecta components are present. Moreover, robust r-process nucleosynthesis yields require inclusion of both neutrino emission and reabsorption in simulations. Advanced neutrino schemes and turbulent viscosity in simulations resolved beyond current standards appear necessary for reliable astrophysical predictions. To carry out computationally demanding simulations of growing complexity, next-generation NR codes that can efficiently leverage the latest pre-exascale many-core and heterogeneous infrastructures are required. To this end we develop GR-Athena++, a new dynamical spacetime solver built on top of Athena++, that shows high-order convergence properties and excellent parallel scalability up to O(105) cores in full 3D binary black hole (BBH) merger simulations. Finally we present GR-AthenaK, the first performance-portable spacetime solver, obtained by refactoring GR-Athena++ with the Kokkos programming model. We demonstrate the correctness and convergence properties of GR-AthenaK with BBH runs on GPUs. GR-AthenaK shows a speedup ∼50 on one GPU compared to GR-Athena++ on a single CPU core.",

Mechanistic studies were done by iterative changes of reaction conditions as well as on substrates and the catalyst. A new proposal of the catalytic cycle was achieved based on experimentally found data. Related Palladium complexes which show either κ1C- or k1N-coordinated triazenide ligands were synthesized and characterized. The synthesis of such complexes provides important evidence for the Hartwig-Buchwald amination derived CDZA reaction of triazenes and amidines. The reaction was found to be slow according to obtained TON and TOF numbers. Additionally, a variety of new NH- and N-methylated triazenes and amidines were provided. A deeper insight into the properties of both substrate classes was achieved (e.g., degradation focused on thermal degradation, pkA values and equilibrium of constitutional and configurational isomers) that allows accurate assessment of analytical data of the CDZA reaction. Since calcium and calciate complexes also catalyze amination reactions further objectives of this work were also the expansion to novel calcium amidinates which are functionalized with heteroatomic groups showing attractive additional coordination site for the A- and Ae-metal. Plenty of those complexes were synthesized and characterized within these studies.",

        "abstract": "Plant organs are colonized by diverse microbial organisms that help the plant to ensure fitness and survival in unpredictable environments. Different factors shape the microbiome of plants including the plant genotype, environmental conditions and microbe-microbe interactions. Certain highly interactive microbes were identified as keystone species in plant-associated microbial communities, i.e. species that are important for the structure and integrity of a community, regardless of its abundance in the ecosystem. Keystones in plant microbiomes could be important in structuring early colonization of plants by microorganisms and in controlling the variability of plant-associated microbiomes. The goal of this project was to evaluate the hypothesis that the plant microbiome is a combination of the microbiomes of the host and its keystones, focusing on early colonization. In this work a new amplicon sequencing pipeline was developed to investigate the leaf microbiomes of nine wild Arabidopsis thaliana population identified in Jena, Germany. We found, that their core microbiome is largely, but not completely shared with other co-habituating ground-dwelling ruderal plant species. The difference between A. thaliana bacteriomes and those of other plants depended on how variable bacteriomes were in each population, which changed between years in each population. We then tested the importance of early microbial colonization in two of the wild A. thaliana populations and one A. thaliana reference strain and identified efficient early colonizers as possible keystone species. We found, that if they influenced microbial community assembly they increased the variation of bacterial communities rather than decreasing it. To summarize, early colonizing bacteria affect the outcome of plant-to-plant variation. We hypothesize that these are bacterial keystone species that do not shape the plants microbiome in a specific way, but rather serve as cues leading to more variability.",

        "abstract": "Permafrost landscapes in the Northern high latitudes with their massive organic carbon stocks are critically important for the global carbon cycle. Large uncertainties in the sustainability of these carbon pools under future climate conditions persist, caused by limited understanding of permafrost carbon cycling processes. A continuous observation program was established near the city of Chersky, NE Siberia, representing a wet tussock tundra ecosystem. Year-round eddy-covariance measurements focused on ecosystem–atmosphere exchange fluxes of carbon. Recent observations started mid-July 2013, while historic measurements are available for the period 2002–2005. Since 2004 part of the observation area has been disturbed by a circular drainage ditch, altering the soil water conditions in a way that is expected for degrading of ice-rich permafrost under a warming climate. In comparison to the strong reduction of fluxes immediately following the drainage disturbance in 2005, recent CO2 exchange with the atmosphere over this disturbed part of the tundra indicate a higher carbon turnover, and a seasonal amplitude that is comparable again to that within the control section. By comparing CO2 budgets from the drained and control ecosystems a systematically reduced sink strength within the drained area is found, dominated by increased respiration due to warmer near-surface soil layers. Reduced CH4 emissions are observed under drier and more aerobic conditions resulting in half the efflux from the drained ecosystem in comparison to the control ecosystem. As a net effect of the drainage an increased source of CO2, eq. to the atmosphere indicates a positive effect on global warming. Year-round measurements emphasize the importance of the non-growing season to the annual budget, with substantial contributions during the zero-curtain period representing the re-freezing of the active layer in fall.",

We have developed a theoretical model of self-action of one-dimensional light beams in (1 1 0) and (1 1 -2)-cut photorefractive sillenite crystals of point group 23 taking into account the additional contribution of the photoelastic effect to the optical properties of the medium, the induced birefringence and the optical activity. The additional photoelastic contribution to the optical properties of the photorefractive cubic medium in some cases can reduce the necessary value of the electric field amplitude by a factor of 1.7 to observe the same magnitude of the self-action effect as in existing theoretical models. he presented theoretical model predicts the possibility to observe quasi-solitons in cubic photorefractive crystals with a large magnitude of optical activity. he experimental and theoretical studies of the laser beam self-bending in bismuth titanium oxide crystals under applied external alternating fields showed that the self-bending magnitude, the self-bending direction and the form of the beam on the output face of the crystal can be controlled by the input polarization of propagated light if the bias field is applied along the direction [1 -1 1].  theoretical model for the investigation of the self-bending effect in barium titanate crystal (BaTiO3) for a speckled extraordinary light beam taking into account the additional elasto-optic contribution was developed for the first time. The model shows that BaTiO3 crystals exhibit the property of positive or negative gradient lenses depending on whether the speckled laser beam propagates along the optical axis c or in the opposite direction.",

Zentrales Element dieses Modells ist die Schaffung von sanktionsbewehrten Pflichten, die gesellschaftlichen Interessen dienen, auf Verhaltenssteuerung zielen und mittels privater Klagerechte durchgesetzt werden.

        "abstract": "Different solutions for far-field light shaping are reviewed. For design algorithms based on geometric optics, typically, a mapping between the irradiance distribution of the input and the target is assumed. In this thesis, the validity of the mapping assumption is analyzed from a physical-optics point of view. It is revealed that it is true only when all the operators in the system modeling are pointwise operators. With the physical-optics modeling techniques, a design strategy is provided that starts from a functional design and continues with a structural design. By applying the inverse method, the light-shaping problem is reduced to a Fourier pair synthesis. For the Fourier pair synthesis, a mapping-type algorithm is introduced in the homeomorphic case. In the proposed method, the solution of the mapping between the Fourier pair is integrable. Therefore, the output wavefront phase can be achieved in a single integration step. After designing the output wavefront phase, the functional embodiment is nothing other than a wavefront phase response (WPR) function. The structural design of light-shaping elements is developed with the obtained WPR function, or more directly with the output wavefront phase. The design of both a holographic optical element (HOE) and a freeform lens for light shaping is demonstrated. The element function of the HOE design is the same as the WPR function. The local grating model is then derived from its element function. A hybrid component by adding a curved surface to the HOE is suggested to reduce the grating effects from the HOE. For the design of a freeform lens, an algorithm is proposed that combines the output wavefront phase design and the construction of the freeform surface in an iterative way. The algorithm has no restriction about the input wavefront and the shape of the predefined surface. Moreover, the Fresnel effect of the freeform surface is also considered in the design.",

        "abstract": "The present work deals with the design and the realisation of a flexible trailing edge system. Goal of the flexible trailing edge system witch consists of a smooth variable cambering is the improvement of the aerodynamic performance for future airliner. The 'Hornconcept' is introduced. Several of hornlike shaped structures are rotatable mounted at a rigid leading edge box of the flap structure. The hornlike structures are covered with a flexible skin structure. The upper and lower skin is connected with flexible webs which gives stiffness in spanwise direction. By turning the horns, the skin structure is forced to adapt the form of the shape of the horns. The main characteristic of the concept is the simple and robust design, the small number of moveable parts and the low necessary actuator forces. The functionality of the concept is shown with the outer flap of the A340 as a reference system. The structural behaviour (stiffness and stress) of the different components is analysed. An actuator system is selected and designed where only two actuators are necessary. The coupling of the individual horns is made with elastic rods. It is shown that such an actuator system fulfils all requirements. With the construction of a demonstrator the practical functionality is analysed. For the manufacturing of the hornlike structures with carbon fiber a special manufacturing process is developed and tested. The process is used for the assembly of the demonstrator. With lifecycle tests the stability of the structure is proved. A finite element model of the whole system with the interacting of horn structure and skin is developed. With this model and with the results of experimental analysis an optimum configuration is found by observance the stiffness requirements. It can be shown that in all load cases the stresses for the structural components are in the limits and the functionality of the concept is kept.",

In „Eine Geschichte mit Geschmack\" geht es um die Prägung von Geschmacksvorstellungen und -wahrnehmungen in der Gesellschaft und um den Umgang mit synthetischen und künstlichen Aromastoffen mit Fokus auf Deutschland im 20. Jahrhundert. Im Kern steht dabei die Frage nach Natürlichkeit, denn das Verständnis von „natürlich\" und „nicht-natürlich\" ist essentiell für den Umgang mit Aromastoffen. Anhand des Ersatzstoffdiskurses und des Natürlichkeitsdiskurses wurde die Entwicklung von Produktion, Verbreitung, Konsum und Regulierung dieser Stoffe nachgezeichnet und in ihren Spezifika analysiert. Vanillin, als der erste chemisch-industriell synthetisierte und als der am meisten verbrauchte Aromastoff, dient dabei als herausstechendes Fallbeispiel. Durch die Analyse von Produktion, Verbreitung, Konsum und Regulierung von Aromastoffen treten die sich verändernden und sich zwischen unterschiedlichen Interessengruppen unterscheidenden Verständnisweisen der Begriffe „natürlich\", „synthetisch\" und „künstlich\" zu Tage.

            "This thesis develops two exciting areas of particle physics research. It applies the recent new insights about the usefulness of helicity amplitudes in understanding gauge theory to the long-standing effort to understand theories with both electric and magnetic charges. It is known that for some supersymmetric theories there is an exact duality that relates two descriptions of the physics, one where the electric charges are weakly coupled and another where the electric charges are strongly coupled. The calculations in this thesis suggest that this duality can also hold in the low-energy limit of nonsupersymmetric gauge theories. The idea of addressing the hierarchy problem of the standard model Higgs mechanism using conformal symmetry is also explored. Analogously to “Little Higgs” models, where divergences are cancelled only at one-loop order, models are studied that have infrared conformal fixed points which related gauge and Yukawa couplings, allowing for a cancellation between seemingly unrelated quantum loop diagrams."

        "abstract": "Induced aberrations in general are higher-order aberrations caused by ray perturbations of lower order, picked up surface by surface in the preceding optical system. Therefore, induced aberration coefficients are depending on the cumulative preexisting aberrations in the system. In case of color aberrations, induced influences are already observable in the paraxial regime, since even paraxial rays are affected by dispersion. Hence, in every optical system small perturbations in ray heights and ray angles for paraxial rays of different wavelengths are present. These ray perturbations generate induced color aberration effects of higher-order. Here, different orders refer to the paraxial ray dependency on dispersion. The linear or 1st-order terms result in the well-known Seidel contributions of axial and lateral color, where any interaction of dispersion between different lenses is neglected. Starting at 2nd-order terms, induced color effects are present. In this thesis, an introduction on the basic idea of induced color aberrations is given, followed by a surface resolved analytical description for 2nd-order axial and lateral color as well as for the chromatic variations of the five Seidel aberrations. A differentiation between induced and intrinsic parts is derived and discussed. Illustrated by descriptive academic systems as well as by a complex microscopic design example, the importance and the influences of induced color aberrations for optical systems is demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "Finding relevant research data is an increasingly important but time-consuming task in daily research practice. Several studies report on difficulties in dataset search, e.g., scholars retrieve only partial pertinent data, and important information can not be displayed in the user interface. Overcoming these problems has motivated a number of research efforts in computer science, such as text mining and semantic search. In particular, the emergence of the Semantic Web opens a variety of novel research perspectives. Motivated by these challenges, the overall aim of this work is to analyze the current obstacles in dataset search and to propose and develop a novel semantic dataset search. The studied domain is biodiversity research, a domain that explores the diversity of life, habitats and ecosystems. This thesis has three main contributions: (1) We evaluate the current situation in dataset search in a user study, and we compare a semantic search with a classical keyword search to explore the suitability of semantic web technologies for dataset search. (2) We generate a question corpus and develop an information model to figure out on what scientific topics scholars in biodiversity research are interested in. Moreover, we also analyze the gap between current metadata and scholarly search interests, and we explore whether metadata and user interests match. (3) We propose and develop an improved dataset search based on three components: (A) a text mining pipeline, enriching metadata and queries with semantic categories and URIs, (B) a retrieval component with a semantic index over categories and URIs and (C) a user interface that enables a search within categories and a search including further hierarchical relations.

        "abstract": "In this thesis we investigate optimal stopping problems with expectation cost constraints. We focus on reducing the set of stopping times as well as on deriving a partial differential equation for the value function. If the process to stop is a time-homogeneous Itˆo-process, we show, by introducing a new state variable, that one can transform the problem into an unconstrained control problem and hence obtain a dynamic programming principle. We characterize the value function in terms of the dynamic programming equation, which turns out to be an elliptic, fully non-linear partial differential equation of second order. In addition, we prove a classical verification theorem and apply it to several examples. Furthermore, we consider the problem of optimally stopping a one-dimensional regular continuous strong Markov process with a stopping time satisfying an expectation constraint. We show that it is sufficient to consider only stopping times such that the law of the process at the stopping time is a weighted sum of 3 Dirac measures. The proof uses results on Skorokhod embeddings in order to reduce the stopping problem to a linear optimization problem over a convex set of probability measures. We apply the results to analyze a sequential testing problem and show that in this problem the optimal stopping times are given by at most two consecutive exit times of intervals. Finally, using the theory of Tchebycheff systems we examine when we can reduce the set of stopping times in the constrained problem to first exit times of intervals. In this case, the law of the process at the stopping time is a weighted sum of at most 2 Dirac measures.",

            "Maillard processes in food or in vivo are connected to negatively associated protein modifications, so called Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs). The cellular glycolysis, ubiquitously located in the cytoplasm, seems to be the main source of methylglyoxal, a highly reactive 1,2-dicarbonyl compound within the Maillard reaction cascade. In the present study, comprehensive mechanistic knowledge of AGE formation in both bakery products and collagen was gained. For both matrices, efficient protocols for protein extraction, solubilization and hydrolysis were developed. Connective tissue was profiled for collagen-bound AGEs and the glycation compound MOLA was identified as a novel amide AGE crosslink in vivo. In parallel, the portfolio of AGEs in wheat bread rolls and other bread types was significantly enlarged on a quantitative basis. In addition, a convenient quantitation method for the aroma compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrrolin was developed and successfully applied to various food matrices.",

The last few centuries have seen continual advances in optical microscopy, driven by the demand to image ever-smaller objects. In recent years, frequency conversion of ultrafast lasers towards the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) regime has significantly enhanced the achievable resolution thanks to shorter wavelengths. The absence of high-magnification optics in the XUV regime is a major issue associated with this technique and is tackled with direct measurement and reconstruction of coherent diffraction patterns. The experimental application of this technique in terms of digital in-line holography and coherent-diffraction imaging is demonstrated on artificial and biological specimens. The book introduces a novel, award-winning cancer-cell classification scheme based on biological imaging. Finally, it presents a newly developed technique for generating structured illumination in the XUV regime and demonstrates its usability for super-resolution imaging",

The synthetic approach of salt metathesis of phosphinic chlorides with alkali metal phosphanides, which was believed to be straightforward to achieve mixed-valent compounds, resulted in unexpected reaction sequences and products. Optimizing the composition of the reagents and altering the substitution on the $\\lambda^3$-phosphorus made it possible to observe the target molecules in solution and some derivates in the solid state. However, the stability of a PP double bond is inferior compared to a CC double bond which could be observed by degradation of target molecules in solution. Recently published results in this field suggest the possibility to utilize mixed-valent phosphorus compounds as phosphinidene transfer reagents. Thus, the degradation of target molecules was intensively studied by kinetic measurements using phosphorus NMR techniques.",

        "abstract": "The way to sustainable chemical production will require carbon capture technologies that allow abundant and cheap carbon dioxide to be available, to be used in carbon fixation processes. Among the non-photosynthetic biological carbon fixation processes, the ones catalyzed by acetogenic bacteria such as gas fermentation and microbial electrosynthesis stand out. Both processes are limited in terms of the range of products they can offer, and although gas fermentation has already reached the industrial scale, microbial electrosynthesis is a process with great potential but still new and not yet developed. The deepening of our knowledge about the metabolism of acetogenic bacteria such as Clostridium ljungdahlii, as well as the development of molecular tools, is crucial for the expansion of the portfolio of products that acetogens can offer. In this thesis, the mode of extracellular electron transfer and the role of hydrogen in microbial electrosynthesis with C. ljungdahlii is unveiled, leading to highly productive planktonic systems that decouple activity from biofilm formation. Furthermore, it is proposed that two putative glycine-based carbon fixation pathways are activated under redox stress conditions, leading to the production in significant quantities of metabolites that are rarely found in microbial electrosynthesis or gas fermentation. The in-situ formation of electrocatalysts promotes the formation of formate on carbon-based cathodes, likely boosting C. ljungdahlii growth, and it represents a promising finding for the future development of catalytic cathodes. The development of molecular tools allowed to establish in C. ljungdahlii an anaerobic fluorescent marker, CRISPR/Cas systems for the generation of deletions, and a heterologous expression system to produce ethyl acetate from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. All these advances will be used synergistically in the future to further expand the product range and improve the selectivity for target metabolites.",

Furthermore, physical properties such as band gap, surface area and absorption can be tuned. g-CN was investigated as heterogeneous catalyst, with diversified applications from water splitting to CO2 reduction and organic coupling reactions.

First  it is shown that the self-organization of financial markets is a crucial factor in the understanding of their dynamics. In fact, using an agent-based approach, it is argued that financial markets’ stylized facts appear only in the self-organized state. Secondly, the thesis points out the potential of so-called big data science for financial market modeling, investigating how web-driven data can yield a picture of market activities:  it has been found that web query volumes anticipate trade volumes. As a third achievement, the metrics developed here for country competitiveness and product complexity is groundbreaking in comparison to mainstream theories of economic growth and technological development.

A classical approach to control biochemical reactions non-invasivly is by changing the temperature.

Optically switching the pH can be achieved by using photoacids.

The two key outcomes of the thesis are: (a) demonstratingfull control over the charge/bond and spin order parameters in specifically designed praseodymium nickelate heterostructures and observation of a novel spin density wave phase in absence of the charge/bond order parameter, which confirms theoretical predictions of a spin density wave phase driven by spatial confinement of the conduction electrons; and (b) assessing the thickness-induced crossover between collinear and non-collinear spin structures in neodymium nickelate slabs, which is correctly predicted by drawing on density functional theory. .",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Electrical deep brain stimulation has long been used as a therapeutic procedure to treat patients suffering from motor symptoms associated with neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. However, the mechanism of action by which it operates is poorly understood with several conflicting hypothesis on its rationale. Illuminating this question might help us understand how and why secondary side effects such as depression and suicidality occur in some patients undergoing electrical high frequency stimulation.<br><br>In this study, based on previously reported results from our research group, the activation of the GABAergic system was studied from a microscopic scale to the effects that it has at a macroscopic behaving scale. We made use of the patch clamp technique to quantify the effects on the microscopic scale. While this quantification is possible using a system with extremely high signal to noise ratio, it becomes a larger problem when the mechanism is to be studied in animal models of disease, using conventional electrophysiology systems. The exploration of the algorithms used to bypass this problem showed us that the usage of these techniques cannot be blindly made, with additional validation techniques to verify that the data recorded is complete. <br><br>To this end, other measurement modalities were made use of to study the cascading effects in the brain as a result of the GABA activation- to study neurochemical and behavioral changes that occur due to electrical high frequency stimulation. We were able to see that the electrical stimulation did induce reduction in the extracellular levels of neurotransmitter responsible for mood regulation, and a corresponding change in the behavior profile was also observed.<br><br>Taken together, the results presented in this thesis helps further the idea that a selective activation of the GABAergic system is responsible for the effect that electrical stimulation has on neuronal tissue, with specific activation of the axonal elements,<br>which are the GABAergic axons. This activation is not limited to a microscopic level, but also to a mesoscopic level, which then leads to cascading effects that lead to significant behavioral changes, all mediated through the GABAergic system",

            "This thesis sheds valuable new light on the second-order cosmological perturbation theory, extensively discussing it in the context of cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations. It explores the observational consequences of the second-order vector mode, and addresses magnetic field generation and the weak lensing signatures, which are key phenomena of the vector mode. The author demonstrates that the second-order vector mode, which never appears at the linear-order level, naturally arises from the non-linear coupling of the first-order scalar modes. This leads to the remarkable statement that the vector-order mode clearly contributes to the generation of cosmological magnetic fields. Moreover, the weak lensing observations are shown to be accessible to the vector mode. On the basis of ongoing and forthcoming observations, the thesis concludes that the second-order vector mode is detectable."

Large apertures, which enable high flow velocities, and a rock matrix with several orders of magnitude lower permeability, are accountable that those structures serve as preferential conduits for solutes and colloids. The mechanistic understanding of fundamental transport and retention processes is essential to make reliable predictions of the fate of solutes and colloids in the subsurface. This comprehensive topic is of paramount importance in many areas of geo-engineering, for example disposal of nuclear waste in deep geological formations, enhanced geothermal systems, CO2 sequestration, gas and oil industry, and contaminant transport in groundwater systems. This cumulative Ph.D. thesis deals with the investigation of the impact of flow channel geometry on solute and colloid transport through natural rough fractures. The bottom-up approach used in this thesis helped to investigate separately the mechanisms and the processes on mass transport (solute and colloids) in four steps. All experiments in this thesis were conducted under hydraulic and chemical settings establishing laminar flow and overall unfavorable colloid attachment conditions.",

Our inability in answering this question lies partly in the deficient knowledge regarding pivotal humanenvironment interactions. Regarded as the most well documented anthropogenic climate modification, the urban heat island (UHI) effect – the warmth of urban areas relative to the rural hinterland – has raised great public health concerns globally. Worse still, heat waves are being observed and are projected to increase in both frequency and intensity, which further impairs the well-being of urban dwellers. Albeit with a substantial increase in the number of publications on UHI in the recent decades, the diverse urban-rural definitions applied in previous studies have remarkably hampered the general comparability of results achieved.

        "abstract": "The complement system protects the host against foreign organisms and induces a non-inflammatory phagocytosis of damaged or mutated host cells. Complement regulators protect intact host cells against complement attack and prevent inflammatory reactions. Factor H is the main soluble regulator of the alternative complement pathway. Factor H binds to host cells and blocks the alternative complement activation to prevent cell- and tissue damages. In addition, Factor H binds the acute phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP). CRP opsonizes apoptotic and necrotic host cells and microbial invaders for phagocytosis by activating the classical complement cascade. However, the amplification loop via the alternative pathway and the pro-inflammatory terminal complement pathway are inhibited. Here I analyzed the role of Factor H binding to CRP in this limitation of complement. Furthermore, the Factor H related (CFHR) proteins CFHR-1, CFHR-4A, and CFHR-4B, which have a high similarity to Factor H, were functionally characterized. In this work I show, that Factor H, CFHR 4A, and CFHR-4B bind different isoforms of CRP. Factor H binds monomeric CRP (mCRP), while CFHR-4A/4B bind pentameric CRP (pCRP). Moreover, the analyzed proteins of the Factor H protein family regulate complement at the surface of cellular debris. Factor H and CFHR 1 inhibit complement and protect cellular debris from inflammatory complement attack, while CFHR 4A/4B enhance the cell opsonization through recruitment of pCRP.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: Introduction: Progression through the cell cycle is tightly regulated by different cyclin-dependent kinases and their activating cyclin subunits. Stage-specific proteolysis of cyclins and other cell cycle regulators is important for transition to the next cell cycle phase. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is an E3-ubiquitin ligase that controls mitosis and G1 through degradation of these proteins. Through its activating subunits Cdh1 and Cdc20 the APC/C assures substrate-specifity. While Cdc20 regulates progression through mitosis, Cdh1 is activated in late mitosis to coordinate accurate entry into S-phase. Thereby, the APC/C is crucial for maintaining genomic stability during the cell cycle.<br>Results: Characterization of a Cdh1-kd revealed strong stabilization of the substrates cyclin A/B leading to diminished loading of mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins on replication origins in G1. Stabilization of cyclin A/B may cause the observed premature entry into S-phase, while the reduced loading of MCMs in G1 could be responsible for the prolonged replication in S-phase seen in Cdh1-kd cells. Plk1 was stabilized in Cdh1-kd cells, which may cause bypass of the Cdh1-Plk1 dependent DNA damage checkpoint. Indeed, potential replication stress in Cdh1-kd cells did not lead to G2/M arrest, but was enforced by inhibition of the Cdh1 substrate Plk1. Underreplicated DNA and replication intermediates in mitosis may be the reason for increased genomic instability, namely lagging chromosomes, anaphase bridges and micronuclei in Cdh1-kd cells detected by live-cell imaging. Monitoring of 53BP1, a DNA-repair marker, in living cells could also prove amplified DNA-damage through increased double-strand breaks in Cdh1-kd cells. In addition, aberrant cytokinesis and the development of tetraploid cells generated by misseparation of chromosomes during mitosis were enhanced in Cdh1-kd cells.<br>Conclusions: Downregulation of the tumor suppressor APC/C-Cdh1 leads to deregulation of DNA-replication by stabilizing cyclin A and B in G1 and reduced loading of replication origins with MCM proteins resulting in enhanced genomic instability",

            "Impurity ions pose a potentially serious threat to fusion plasma performance by affecting the confinement in various, usually deleterious, ways. Due to the creation of helium ash during fusion reactions and the interaction of the plasma with the wall components, which makes it possible for heavy ions to penetrate into the core plasma, impurities can intrinsically not be avoided. Therefore, it is essential to study their behaviour in the fusion plasma in detail. Within the framework of this thesis, different problems arising in connection with impurities have been investigated. 1. Collisional damping of zonal flows in tokamkas: The effect of impurities on the collisional damping of zonal flows is investigated. Since the Coulomb collision frequency increases with increasing ion charge, heavy, highly charged impurities play an important role in this process. The effect of such impurities on the linear response of the plasma to an external potential perturbation, as caused by zonal flows, is calculated with analytical methods and compared with numerical simulations, resulting in good agreement. 2. Impurity transport driven by microturbulence in tokamaks: Fine scale turbulence driven by microinstabilities is a source of particle and heat transport in a fusion reactor. A semi-analytical model is presented describing the resulting impurity fluxes and the stability boundary of the underlying mode ...",

Starting with a general introduction to the physics of cold atoms and optical lattices, it extends the theory to that of systems with different multispecies atoms. It advances the theory of many-body quantum systems in excited bands (of optical lattices) through an extensive study of the properties of both the mean-field and strongly correlated regimes. Particular emphasis is given to the context of quantum simulation, where as shown here, the orbital degree of freedom in excited bands allows the study of exotic models of magnetism not easily achievable with the previous alternative systems. In addition, it proposes a new model Hamiltonian that serves as a quantum simulator of various disordered systems in different symmetry classes that can easily be reproduced experimentally. This is of great interest, especially for the study of disorder in 2D quantum systems. ."

            "Lipid analysis of Wadden Sea sediments showed a significant component of terrestrial organic matter derived from erosion of Holocene peat layers in this highly dynamic area. In order to characterise these peats and their remnants in tidal flat sediments in a paleochemotaxonomical way recent plant material as well as different peats were selected for biomarker investigation. The occurrence and the distribution pattern of characteristic biomarkers like n-alkanes and triterpenoids show that the molecular composition of peat-forming plants corresponds to that of the lipid extracts from Wadden Sea sediments. Because the vegetation communities of the original mires react extremely sensitive to changing environmental conditions, peat deposits are the best indicators for sea level variations in the Wadden Sea.  The results of the organic geochemical analysis of coastal peats can thus be used as indicators of temporal Holocene vegetation variations. <engl.>",

        "abstract": "This dissertation focuses on the investigation and development of an optical biosensor based on fiber-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (FERS) that provides chemical selective and sensitive label-free detection of biomolecules. FERS has been achieved by using various types of liquid core optical fibers, which guide the light within the liquid sample and increase the interaction length with the analyte molecules. The first part of this dissertation explains the FERS technique in detail and describes the current state of research of FERS. Several essential characteristics, such as fiber length, attenuation, material and refractive index, are thoroughly discussed in considerations of Raman intensity enhancement. Liquid-core fibers formed with hollow-core photonic-crystal fibers (HC-PCFs) and polymer fibers are introduced and discussed, as they are the most important breakthroughs. The objective of this research is to develop a robust optical fiber platform based on Raman spectroscopy that shows potential for use in bio-analytical and clinical applications. In this work, I demonstrate a combination of UV-resonance Raman spectroscopy (UV-RRS) and liquid-core fibers, to increases the sensitivity for the detection of low-concentrated pharmaceuticals tremendously. This combined enhancement technique was applied for the detection of bile pigments for monitoring of diseases related to hyperbilirubinemia and hyperbiliverdinemia. Their poor optical quality strongly limits the performances of the polymer-based liquid-core fibers. Therefore, the implementation of HC-PCFs was explored in two different types of optical guiding. Waveguiding in the visible range is achieved for the first time in both kinds of liquid-filled HC-PCFs, and therefore the Raman scattering wavelengths are not anymore limited to the insensitive NIR range. In order to achieve easy-to-use and stable FERS devices for further development, the performance of HC-PCFs in the aspect of light-confinement was studied with the help of a specially designed multi-channel Raman chemical imaging. The optimal fiber length, spatial filtering, and optical coupling were thoroughly analyzed, and an automatic coupling system was developed. With the development of optical fibers, FERS shows increasing potential as a robust, fast, chemical selective and sensitive tool for the detection of biomolecules in clinical, pharmaceutical, and biological applications.",

Currently, it is not possible to predict the pandemic potential of avian influenza A viruses. We now describe a new mouse model suitable for risk assessment. It is based on the finding that innate restriction factors represent effective species barriers that need to be overcome by viruses trying to invade a human host. In mice, innate immune control of influenza viruses is mediated by the interferon-regulated Mx1 gene. The MX1 orthologue of humans (encoding MxA protein) provides broad resistance to influenza and other viruses in cell culture systems. MxA is targeting the nucleoprotein of influenza A viruses which encapsidates the viral genome and is pivotal to virus replication. Influenza A viruses that successfully established stable lineages in humans acquired adaptive mutations in the nucleoprotein that allow partial MxA escape in cell culture experiments. Our new mouse strain lacks functional endogenous Mx genes but instead carries the human MX1 locus as transgene. Our transgenic mice were largely resistant to highly pathogenic avian H5 and H7 influenza A viruses, but were almost as susceptible to infection with influenza viruses of human origin as non-transgenic littermates. We further demonstrate that an engineered avian H7N7 influenza virus carrying a nucleoprotein with signature mutations typically found in human virus isolates was more virulent in transgenic mice than the parental virus. These findings illustrate that a few amino acid changes in the viral nucleoprotein can mediate escape from MxA restriction in vivo. They further suggest that equivalent mutations need to be acquired by any emerging influenza A viruses before the ...",

            "This thesis provides a detailed introduction to quantum oscillation measurement and analysis and offers a connection between Fermi surface properties and superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors. It also discusses the field of iron-based superconductors and tests the models for the appearance of nodes in the superconducting gap of a 111-type pnictide using quantum oscillation measurements combined with band structure calculation. The same measurements were carried out to determine the quasiparticle mass in BaFe2(As1-xPx)2, which is strongly enhanced at the expected quantum critical point. While the lower superconducting critical field shows evidence of quantum criticality, the upper superconducting critical field is not influenced by the quantum critical point. These findings contradict conventional theories, demonstrating the need for a theoretical treatment of quantum critical superconductors, which has not been addressed to date. The quest to discover similar evidence in the cuprates calls for the application of extreme conditions. As such, quantum oscillation measurements were performed under high pressure in a high magnetic field, revealing a negative correlation between quasiparticle mass and superconducting critical temperature."

With recent advances in ecology, biochemistry and genetics it is becoming increasingly clear that real systems are in fact subject to a great deal of noise. Relevant examples include social insects competing for resources, molecules undergoing chemical reactions in a cell and a pool of genomes subject to evolution. When the population size is small, novel macroscopic phenomena can arise, which can be analyzed using the theory of stochastic processes. This thesis is centered on two unsolved problems in population dynamics: the symmetry breaking observed in foraging populations, and the robustness of spatial patterns.

Currently, this so-called batch processing is executed manually or supported by external software. Only few research proposals exist to explicitly represent and execute batch processing needs in business process models. These works also lack a comprehensive understanding of requirements.

            "This book reports on the search for a new heavy particle, the Vector-Like Top quark (VLT), in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The signal process is the pair production of VLT decaying into a Higgs boson and top quark (TT→Ht+X, X=Ht, Wb, Zt). The signal events result in top–antitop quarks final states with additional heavy flavour jets. The book summarises the analysis of the data collected with the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. In order to better differentiate between signals and backgrounds, exclusive taggers of top quark and Higgs boson were developed and optimised for VLT signals. These efforts improved the sensitivity by roughly 30%, compared to the previous analysis. The analysis outcomes yield the strongest constraints on parameter space in various BSM theoretical models. In addition, the book addresses detector operation and the evaluation of tracking performance. These efforts are essential to properly collecting dense events and improving the accuracy of the reconstructed objects that are used for particle identification. As such, they represent a valuable contribution to data analysis in extremely dense environments"

        "abstract": "Although glasses are commonly thought of as ideal brittle materials, a local plastic deformation can be induced by the penetration of sharp objects, such as the indenter tips commonly employed for hardness testing. Since the first experimental verification of this phenomenon, considerable research effort has been devoted to the underlying microscopic mechanisms, which govern the indentation deformation of glasses, but also to associated properties of technological relevance, like crack initiation and defect tolerance, fracture toughness, brittleness or even scratchability. In early indentation studies, this has been achieved through a post-mortem topographic or spectroscopic analysis of the residual hardness imprints left on the glass surface. However, with the ongoing demand for a mechanical characterization at small-scales, advanced indentation protocols have been developed, which nowadays allow for a more comprehensive description of the fundamental deformation processes in amorphous materials and by extension, the design of more defect-tolerant glasses. But regardless of the numerous studies on the contact damage resistance of glasses, the time or rate dependence of the indentation deformation, commonly referred to as creep, still remains poorly understood. To overcome this issue, the influence of the imposed strain-rate on the hardness of a variety of glasses with covalent, ionic and metallic bonding character as well as varying degrees of network dimensionality and atomic packing density was characterized in a nanoindentation strain-rate jump test. Based on these results, a qualitative mechanistic description of the topological principles that determine the rate dependence of the glass hardness has been proposed.",

        "abstract": "The computational analysis of argumentation strategies is substantial for many downstream applications. It is required for nearly all kinds of text synthesis, writing assistance, and dialogue-management tools. While various tasks have been tackled in the area of computational argumentation, such as argumentation mining and quality assessment, the task of the computational analysis of argumentation strategies in texts has so far been overlooked. This thesis principally approaches the analysis of the strategies manifested in the persuasive argumentative discourses that aim for persuasion as well as in the deliberative argumentative discourses that aim for consensus. To this end, the thesis presents a novel view of argumentation strategies for the above two goals. Based on this view, new models for pragmatic and stylistic argument attributes are proposed, new methods for the identification of the modelled attributes have been developed, and a new set of strategy principles in texts according to the identified attributes is presented and explored. Overall, the thesis contributes to the theory, data, method, and evaluation aspects of the analysis of argumentation strategies. The models, methods, and principles developed and explored in this thesis can be regarded as essential for promoting the applications mentioned above, among others.",

        "abstract": "Speech recognition technology is being increasingly employed in human-machine interfaces. A remaining problem however is the robustness of this technology to non-native accents, which still cause considerable difficulties for current systems. In this book, methods to overcome this problem are described. A speaker adaptation algorithm that is capable of adapting to the current speaker with just a few words of speaker-specific data based on the MLLR principle is developed and combined with confidence measures that focus on phone durations as well as on acoustic features. Furthermore, a specific pronunciation modelling technique that allows the automatic derivation of non-native pronunciations without using non-native data is described and combined with the previous techniques to produce a robust adaptation to non-native accents in an automatic speech recognition system",

        "abstract": "In this thesis, I overcome the challenges and fill the gaps in knowledge for the design and analysis of photonic crystal slab waveguides (PCSWs) as spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) sources of photon-pairs, as well as to investigate their potential for engineering the properties of the photon-pair quantum state. I have developed the required formalism for analyzing both the quantum process of SPDC and its classical counterpart of second-harmonic generation (SHG). In studying SHG, I verified my formalism through comparing its results with direct nonlinear simulations. In these formulations, special attention was given to treating lossy modes, as they prove to be an inherent part of the SPDC designs in PCSWs. Moreover, I have found a practical set of PCSW designs, phase-matched for three-wave-mixing processes, while demonstrating that PCSWs can offer a strong control over the phase-matching configuration. This includes reaching phase-matching between modes of different propagation directions, reaching simultaneous phase-matching between multiple processes, and controlling the group velocity of the modes at the point of phase-matching. These capabilities proved to be the key to discovering the unique strength of PCSWs for the SPDC application. Through the use of various phase-matching configurations, I showed how compact SPDC sources can be designed using PCSWs that are capable of creating entanglement and tuning its extent in different degrees of freedom, with specific examples for path and spectral degrees of entanglement, all in a fully integrated way and directly at the generation step. This work also includes my experimental results on characterizing lithium niobate nanostructured ridge waveguides, demonstrating phase-matched SHG. Finally, I propose the concept of atom-mediated SPDC, for interfacing a single-emitter source with a photon-pair source, relying on the bandgap evanescent modes of a periodic waveguide.",

            "The tale of the combat between the Storm-god and the Sea that began circulating in the early second millennium BCE was one of the most well-known ancient Near Eastern myths. Its widespread dissemination in distinct versions across disparate locations and time periods – Syria, Egypt, Anatolia, Ugarit, Mesopotamia, and Israel – calls for analysis of all the textual variants in order to determine its earliest form, geo-cultural origin, and transmission history. In undertaking this task, Noga Ayali-Darshan examines works such as the Astarte Papyrus, the Pišaiša Myth, the Songs of Hedammu and Ullikummi, the Baal Cycle, Enūma eliš, and pertinent biblical texts. She interprets these and other related writings philologically according to their provenance and comparatively in the light of parallel texts. The examination of this story appearing in all the ancient Near Eastern cultures also calls for a discussion of the theology, literature, and history of these societies and the way they shaped the local versions of the myth.",
            "Die Erzählung vom Kampf zwischen dem Sturmgott und dem Meer, welche ab dem frühen zweiten Jahrtausend v.Chr. kursierte, war eine der bekanntesten Sagen des Alten Orients. Ihre umfassende Verbreitung in unterschiedlichen Fassungen über verschiedene Orte und Perioden – Syrien, Ägypten, Anatolien, Ugarit, Mesopotamien und Israel – verlangen eine Analyse aller Textformen, um die früheste Fassung, ihren geokulturellen Ursprung und die Überlieferungsgeschichte zu ermitteln. Dafür untersucht Noga Ayali-Darshan Texte wie den Astarte Papyrus, den Pišaiša Mythos, das Hedammu-Lied und das Lied von Ullikummi, den Baal-Zyklus, Enūma eliš und relevante Bibeltexte. Sie interpretiert diese und andere, ähnliche Texte philologisch je nach Herkunft und vergleichend nebeneinander. Die Untersuchung dieser Erzählung, die in allen Kulturen des Alten Orients auftaucht, verlangt auch eine Debatte um die Theologie, Literatur und Geschichte dieser Gesellschaften und wie sie die lokale Fassung dieses Mythos formten."

        "abstract": "In this thesis we investigate optimal stopping problems with expectation cost constraints. We focus on reducing the set of stopping times as well as on deriving a partial differential equation for the value function. If the process to stop is a time-homogeneous Itˆo-process, we show, by introducing a new state variable, that one can transform the problem into an unconstrained control problem and hence obtain a dynamic programming principle. We characterize the value function in terms of the dynamic programming equation, which turns out to be an elliptic, fully non-linear partial differential equation of second order. In addition, we prove a classical verification theorem and apply it to several examples. Furthermore, we consider the problem of optimally stopping a one-dimensional regular continuous strong Markov process with a stopping time satisfying an expectation constraint. We show that it is sufficient to consider only stopping times such that the law of the process at the stopping time is a weighted sum of 3 Dirac measures. The proof uses results on Skorokhod embeddings in order to reduce the stopping problem to a linear optimization problem over a convex set of probability measures. We apply the results to analyze a sequential testing problem and show that in this problem the optimal stopping times are given by at most two consecutive exit times of intervals. Finally, using the theory of Tchebycheff systems we examine when we can reduce the set of stopping times in the constrained problem to first exit times of intervals. In this case, the law of the process at the stopping time is a weighted sum of at most 2 Dirac measures.",
